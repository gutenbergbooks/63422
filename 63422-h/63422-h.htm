<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>In</span> addition to the illustrated feature for exhibiting the nature
and practical application of X-rays, and for simplifying the descriptions,
the book involves the disclosure of the facts and principles
relating to the phenomena occurring between and around charged
electrodes, separated by different gaseous media at various pressures.
The specific aim is the treatment of the radiant energy
developed within and from a discharge tube, the only source of
X-rays.</p>

<p class='c008'>Having always admired the plan adopted by German investigators
in publishing accounts of their experiments by means of
numbered paragraphs containing cross-references and sketches, the
author has likewise treated the investigations of a large number
of physicists. The cross-references are indicated by the section
sign (§). By reference, the <i>analogy</i>, <i>contrast</i>, or <i>suggestiveness</i> may
be meditated upon. All knowledge of modern physics is based
upon experiments as the original source. Inasmuch as many years
may be expected to elapse before the innumerable peculiarities of
the electrical discharge will be reduced to a pure science, and also
in order that the contents of the book may be of value in the
future as well as at present, the characteristic experiments of
electricians and scientists are described, in general, by reference to
their object, the apparatus used, the result, the inferences of the
experimenter, and the observations of cotemporaneous or later
physicists, together with a presentation here and there of theoretical
matters and allusion to practical applications.</p>

<p class='c008'>The classes of reader to which the book is adapted may best be
known, of course, after perusal, but some advance intimation of the
kind that the author had in view may be desired. Let it be
known that, first, the student and those generally interested in science
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ii'>ii</span>ought to be able to comprehend the subject-matter, because
experiments are described, which are always the simplest means
(<i>e.g.</i>, in a popular lecture) for explaining the wonders of any given
scientific principles or facts. Thus did Crookes, Tyndall, Thomson
(both Kelvin and J. J.), Hertz, etc., disseminate knowledge—by
describing their researches and reasoning thereon.</p>

<p class='c008'>In view of the tremendous amount of experimenting which has
been carried on during the past few years in connection with the
electric discharge, it was difficult to determine just how far back to
begin (without starting at the very beginning), so that the student
and general reader, whose object is to become acquainted especially
with the properties of cathode and X-rays, might better understand
them. The author realized that it was necessary to go back
further and further in this department of science, and he could not
easily stop until he had reached certain investigations of Faraday,
Davy, Page, and others, which are briefly noticed in an introductory
sense. Take, for example, the inaction of the magnet upon X-rays
in open air. <a href='#E79'>§ 79</a>. Of course, it would be of interest for the student
to know about Lenard’s investigations relating to the action
of the magnet upon cathode rays inside of the observing tube.
<a href='#E72a'>§ 72<i>a</i></a>. It would follow, further, that he would desire to know about
Crookes’ experiment relating to the attraction of the magnet upon
cathode rays within the tube. <a href='#E59'>§ 59</a>. In order that he might not
infer that Crookes was the first to investigate the action of the magnet
upon the discharge, it was evident that the book could be made
of greater value by relating the experiments of Prof. J. J. Thomson
as to the discharge across and along the lines of magnetic force,
<a href='#E31'>§ 31</a>, and Plücker’s experiment on the action of the magnet upon
the cathode column of light. <a href='#E30'>§ 30</a>. The interest became increased,
instead of diminished, by noting De la Rive’s experiment
on the rotation of the luminous effect of the discharge by means of
the magnet. <a href='#E29'>§ 29</a>. Being now quite impossible to stop, Davy’s
electric arc and magnetic action upon the same had to be alluded
to, at least briefly. <a href='#E28'>§ 28</a>. On the other hand, the very earliest
experiments with the discharge in rarefied air are not described—occurring
as remotely as the eighteenth century—so ably treated of
in Park Benjamin’s work. Those facts that have some mutual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iii'>iii</span>bearing are brought forward to serve as stepping-stones to the
investigation of cathode and X-rays.</p>

<p class='c008'>Secondly, the author often imagined that he was writing in
behalf of the surgeon and physician and those who intend to experiment,
especially when he found in his investigations of recent
publications descriptions in detail of the electrical apparatus employed
in experimenting with X-rays. He improved the opportunity
of repeating the statements of the difficulties, and how they
were overcome; also, the precautions necessary to be taken, and,
besides, the kind of discharge tubes and apparatus best adapted for
particular kinds of experiments. The chapter on applications in
diagnosis and anatomy, etc., is of especial interest to physicians.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thirdly, as the discovery of the Roentgen rays has established a
new department of photography, those who are interested in this art
may be benefited by the results and suggestions disclosed in connection
with photographic plates, time of exposure, adjuncts for
best results, precautions for obtaining sharp shadows, and steps of the
process, from beginning to end, for carrying on the operation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fourthly, expert physicists and electricians, professors, etc., need
something that the above classes do not, and this is the reason why
the author has not assumed the burden of carrying any line of
thought or theory from the beginning to the end of the treatise, nor
has he made the book in any way a personal matter by criticising
experiments, nor even by favoring the views of one over the other,
unless it is in an exceptional case here and there; but in each instance
the investigator’s name is given, and that of the publication
in which the account may be found, so that the scientist may refer
thereto to test the correctness of the author’s version of the matter,
or to learn the nature of the minute details and circumstances.</p>

<p class='c008'>The author suggests that the study of the phenomena of the discharge
tube would not be amiss in scientific schools and colleges.
He argues that in view of all experimenters in this line having been
made enthusiastic and fascinated by reason of (1) the beautiful effects,
(2) the field being always open to new discoveries, (3) the direct
practical and theoretical bearing of the peculiar actions upon other
departments of electricity, light, heat, and magnetism, (4) the pleasure
in attempting to obtain results reported by others, and especially
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>the large amount of valuable theoretical and practical instruction
resulting therefrom, by repeating the experiments or studying
them, and (5) the possible applications of the discharge tube in connection
with electric lighting and in the new department of sciagraphy
by X-rays, and for other good and valuable considerations—it
follows that students who have been through or who are studying
a text-book of physics and electricity would be greatly benefited
by a course in the discharge-tube phenomena.</p>

<p class='c008'>In view of the large amount of dictation necessary in order to
complete the work in such a short period, and in order that the subject-matter
might involve the treatment of the latest work of the
French and German as well as of the English and American, and
inasmuch as the journals of the latter did not always contain complete
translations and, for better service in behalf of the readers, the
authorship was shared with others, and, therefore, much credit is
due to Prof. Anthony for final chapter, to Mr. Louis M. Pignolet for
assistance in connection with French periodicals and academy papers
(<a href='#E63a'>§ § 63<i>a</i></a>, <a href='#E84'>84</a>, <a href='#E99'>99</a>, <a href='#E101a'>101<i>a</i></a>,
<a href='#E103a'>103<i>a</i></a>, <a href='#E112a'>112<i>a</i></a>, <a href='#E124a'>124<i>a</i></a>, <a href='#E128'>128</a>,
<i>at end</i>, <a href='#E139a'>139<i>a</i></a>, <a href='#E154'>154</a>, <a href='#E155'>155</a>,
<a href='#E156'>156</a>, <a href='#E157'>157</a>, <a href='#E158'>158</a>, and <a href='#E159a'>159</a>); to Mr. N. D. C. Hodges,
formerly editor
and proprietor of <i>Science</i>, who obtained some pertinent accounts,
(<a href='#E97a'>§ 97<i>a</i></a>, <a href='#E97b'>97<i>b</i></a>, <a href='#E99A'>99<i>A</i></a>, <a href='#E99B'><i>B</i></a>,
<a href='#E99C'><i>C</i></a>, <a href='#E99D'><i>D</i></a>, to <a href='#E99T'>99<i>T</i></a>, inclusive) by investigations of
recent literature at the Astor Library, New York; and also to Mr.
Ludwig Gutmann (Member American Institute of Electrical Engineers)
for a few translations from the German.</p>

<p class='c008'>Credit is given in each instance to all societies and publications
by naming them in the respective paragraphs herein. In nearly
every case the author prepared his material from original articles
and papers contributed by the investigators to the societies or
periodicals.</p>

<p class='c008'>The author has prepared himself to withstand, with about half
as much patience as he expects will be required, all criticisms based
upon disappointments which may be experienced by the true, or the
alleged true, first discoverer of any particular property of the electric
discharge not duly credited. He has been particular in presenting
knowledge as to physical facts and principles, but not equally,
perhaps, as to the originator of the experiment, or as to the actual first
discoverer, for the simple reason that the book is in no sense a history
<span class='pageno' id='Page_v'>v</span>not a biography. Where the paragraph has been headed, for example,
“Swinton’s Experiment,” it means that that party (according
to the article purporting to be written by him) made that
experiment. Some one else may have made exactly the same experiment
previously, yet the instruction is equally as valuable as though
the researches of the first discoverer had been related. On the other
hand, the author has never had any intention of giving credit to the
wrong party. The dates in the captions indicate the general chronological
order in behalf of those thus interested. With this explanation,
it is thought that the claimants will be much more lenient in
their criticisms concerning priority of discovery. While the developments
have generally followed each other historically, as well as appropriately
for the purpose of instruction, yet now and then it was
preferable to place the description of a comparatively recent experiment
in conjunction with some description of an experiment made
at a much earlier date. For this reason, also, the book is not of a
chronological nature. The subject-matter, as usual, is divided into
chapters, but the sections are to be considered as subordinate chapters,
having different shades of meaning, and the one not necessarily
bearing a direct relation to the contents of its neighbor, but as, in a
novel or a treatise on geometry, having its important part to play in
conjunction with some later or preceding section.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>
<hr class='c007' />
<p class='c008'>The new form of energy, for which there are two names—to wit,
the Roentgen ray and the X-ray—is radiated from a highly exhausted
discharge tube, which may be energized by an induction coil or
other suitable electrical apparatus, such as a Holtz or a Wimshurst
electrical machine. <a href='#E106'>§ 106</a>. The principle underlying the construction
of the usual induction (or Ruhmkorff) coil is disclosed in the
subject-matter of <a href='#E1'>§ § 1</a>, <a href='#E2'>2</a>, and <a href='#E3'>3</a>, and is represented in diagram in Figs.
1 and 2 on page <a href='#i017'>17</a>. It would be well for the amateur or general
scientific reader to study these sections carefully, for then he will
have all the knowledge that is necessary for understanding the apparatus
by which the discharge tube is energized. Of course, he
will not comprehend the various mechanical details, nor the many
electrical and mathematical relations existing in connection with an
induction coil, but he will gain sufficient knowledge to appreciate
what is intended when such a device is referred to here and there
throughout the book. Since the time of Faraday, Page, and Fizeau
induction coils of very large dimensions have been constructed, but
none of them probably ever exceeded that built by Spottiswoode, during
or about 1875, which was so powerful as to produce between the
two electric terminals, in open air, a spark of 42 in. in the secondary
current with only 30 small galvanic cells of the Grove type in
the primary circuit. The cells are seldom used in this connection
at the present time, the same being replaced by the dynamo, and the
current being conveniently obtained from the regular incandescent-lamp
circuit which may be found in almost any city. Those, therefore,
who intend to become better acquainted with the details of the
electrical apparatus should study in conjunction with this book
some elementary treatise relating particularly to dynamos and electric
currents.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>The essential element in connection with the generation of
X-rays is not the coil nor the dynamo, but the electric discharge,
especially when occurring within a rarefied atmosphere, provided
within a glass bulb, called the discharge tube throughout the
book, but which has usually been called by different names, for example,
the receiver of an air pump, or a Geissler tube, when the air
is not very highly exhausted, or a Crookes tube (see picture at <a href='#E123'>§ 123</a>)
when the vacuum is definitely much higher by way of contrast.
It has also been called a Hittorff tube, the Lenard tube, and by
several other names, according to its peculiar characteristics.</p>

    <div>FROM SCIAGRAPHS BY PROF. DAYTON C. MILLER. <a href='#E204'>§ 204</a>.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>For those who are not acquainted with the nature of the electric
charge and discharge, nor with the peculiar and exceedingly interesting
phenomena which various investigators have discovered
from time to time, nor with the variety of effects according to the
nature and the pressure of the atmosphere within the glass bulb, it is
exceedingly difficult to understand with any degree of satisfaction
the properties, principles, laws, theories, and manner of application
of cathode and X-rays. Consequently, the greater part of the book
treats of the electric charge and discharge in conjunction with certain
kindred phenomena. Primarily, the meaning of the electric
discharge may be derived by referring to Fig. 2, page <a href='#i017'>17</a>, where
there is shown an electric spark, indicated by radial lines between
the terminals of a fine wire forming the long and fine coil or secondary
circuit. Imagine that the wires are at great distances apart.
Let them be brought closer and closer together. By suitable
tests it will be found, for example, that no current passes
through the wire, but when the points are brought sufficiently close
together a spark will occur between the two terminals. <a href='#E2'>§ 2</a>. Sometimes
instead of what is understood as a spark, a brush or glow takes
place (<a href='#E10'>§ § 10</a> and <a href='#E11'>11</a>), and in fact a numerous variety of effects occur,
a general name for all being conveniently termed an electric discharge.
Even if no sudden discharge takes place, yet, as when the
terminals are far apart, there may be a charge or a tendency, or, as
it is technically called, a difference of potential, between the two
electrodes, one of which is the cathode and the other the anode.
This is comparable to a weight upon one’s hand, tending continually
to fall, and always exerting a pressure, and it will fall when the hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>is suddenly removed. This is in the nature more of an analogy than
of an exact correspondence. A discharge through open air, while
adapted to produce a great many curious as well as useful effects,
does not act as a generator of X-rays. <a href='#E136'>§ 136</a>. Another class of
phenomena is obtainable by exhausting the air to a certain extent
from a discharge tube, thereby obtaining what is usually called a
low vacuum. Such bulbs have been called Geissler tubes. Neither
can X-rays be generated therefrom to any practicable extent, but
only feebly if at all. <a href='#E118'>§ 118</a>. Hittorff, Varley (<a href='#E61a'>§ 61<i>a</i></a>),
Crookes (<a href='#E53'>§ § 53</a> to <a href='#E61'>61</a>, inclusive),
were the first to discover and study the different
phenomena that are obtained by diminishing the pressure within the
discharge tube to a decrement of several thousand millionths of an
atmosphere. This will explain why so many allusions have been
made to the Crookes tube, for when the electric discharge is caused
to take place in such a high vacuum X-rays are propagated in full
strength.</p>

<p class='c008'>Upon the first announcement of the discovery, electricians, eminent
and otherwise, were of one mind in assuming the possibility of
obtaining Roentgen rays from other sources than that of the highly
evacuated discharge tube. Instead of speculating and theorizing,
hosts of crucial tests were instituted, resulting negatively, and it is
now safe to conclude that the electric discharge is the only primary
source, and it is reasonably safe to assert that the discharge must
take place within a highly evacuated enclosure.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next stage of exhaustion, of no advantage to be considered,
is that at which no discharge takes place (<a href='#E25'>§ 25</a>), and neither are any
Roentgen rays propagated therefrom.</p>

Induction.</span> <i>Experimental Researches, Proc. Royal. So. 1841.</i>—In
brief, the experiment involved the elements illustrated in the
accompanying diagram, Fig. 1, p. <a href='#i017'>17</a>; a ring made of iron;
upon the ring, two coils of copper wire, suitably insulated from
each other and from the iron; a galvanometer included in circuit
with one coil, and an electric battery of ten cells placed in
circuit with the other coil. He found that upon breaking or
completing connection with the battery, the needle was powerfully
deflected. Without entering into further detail, it is important,
however, to notice that he did not perform any
experiments tending to establish the principle of increase of
<span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> by making the very slight change now known to be
necessary. <a href='#E2'>§ 2</a>.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E2'></a>2. <span class='sc'>Page’s Experiment, 1838. Electric Spark by Induced
Current.</span> <i>Pynchon</i>, p. 427. Dr. Page performed an experiment
in which the primary coil was but a few feet in length, while
the secondary coil was 320 ft. He included, in the primary circuit,
only a few cells of battery. The manner in which he first
caused rapid interruptions of the circuit of the primary coil was
by the use of what may be called a coarse file, Fig. 2, p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>.
He discovered that the <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> during the rapid interruption
was so much increased over that of the small battery, that an
electric spark would pass between the secondary terminals without
first bringing them into contact with each other. <a href='#E6'>§ 6</a>. The
result of these experiments was not only the generation of a
current of high <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> from a generator of low <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span>, but
also a current of great quantity as compared with currents obtained
from frictional and influence machines, whose complete
history is found in Mascart’s work on Electricity.</p>

that the sparks between the two terminals of the interrupter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>produced by the self-induced current were greatly diminished,
while those of the secondary coil were about double in length.
Since that time it has been universally customary to equip induction

G. Vincentini and M. Cinelli found that the molecules of a gas
at and near the surface of a platinum wire, rendered incandescent
by a current, are electrified, and that with hydrogen their potential
is about .025 volt above the mean potential
of the wire. With air and carbonic
acid gas the increment is about 1 volt. The
apparatus, Fig. <a href='#i002'>II</a>., consists essentially of
means for passing a current along a platinum
wire, a bulb for preventing draughts, and an
electrometer having a platinum disc electrode
that could be adjusted to different positions. It was noticeable
that the electrification did not reach a maximum instantaneously
upon closing the current through the wire, but the time was
less at points below the wire than above.</p>

The generator employed in this experiment consisted of a few
cells of a chemical battery, and he obtained, what he called, a
voltaic spark. He observed that when the two terminals touched
each other, a burning took place and an appearance as if the
spark were passing on making the contact, the terminals being
pointed and formed of metal. When mercury was the terminal,
the luminosity of the spark was much greater than with platinum
or gold, although the same quantity of current passed in both
cases. He attributed the difference to a greater amount of
combustion in the case of mercury, than in those of gold and
platinum. He obtained almost a continuous spark by bringing
down a pointed copper wire to the surface of mercury and withdrawing
it slightly. Wheatstone, in 1835, analysed the light of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>sparks, and found them to be so characteristic that by means of
the prism and the spectra formed, the metal could be known.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='E7'></a>7. <span class='sc'>Wurts’s Experiment. Non-arcing metals at high voltage.</span>
<i>Trans. Amer. Inst. Elect. Eng.</i> March 15, 1892. <i>Ann. Chem.
Phar. Sup.</i> VII, 354 and VIII, 133. <i>Chem. News</i>, VII, 70; X, 59,
and XXXII, 21, 129.—Mendelejeff and Meyer discovered that
chemical elements occur in natural groups by a principle which
they termed the periodic law. One of these groups includes zinc,
cadmium, mercury and magnesium; and another group, antimony,
bismuth, phosphorus and arsenic. Alex. J. Wurts, of the
Westinghouse Electric Co. found that the metals of these groups
are non-arcing, by which he means that with an alternating current
dynamo of a thousand or more volts, and with the said
metals as electrodes in the air only just escaping each other, it
is impossible to maintain an arc as in the case of an ordinary arc
lamp having carbon electrodes or in a lightning arrester usually
having copper electrodes. He suggested and theorized that
certain chemical reactions served to explain the phenomena.
With low voltage—as 500, the arc was maintained between all
metals. <a href='#E6'>§ 6</a>. A two pole lightning arrester is shown in Fig.
<a href='#i003'>III</a> The arc formed, ceased instantly. One of the best metals
for practical use is an alloy of 1/2 zinc and 1/2
antimony, or any metal electroplated with a
non-arcing metal. Freedman observed a critical
point with electrodes of brass. The current
was gradually reduced until the arc became
like the discharge of a Holtz machine
whose condensers have been disconnected. See <i>Elect. Power</i>,
N.Y., Feb. 1896, p. 119.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E8'></a>8. <span class='sc'>Wheatstone’s Experiment. Duration of Spark.</span> <i>Phil.
Tran.</i> 1834.—The short duration of an electric spark produced
by a single disruptive discharge is easily made apparent by a
rapidly rotating disc, having radial sectional areas of different
colors. With reflected sunlight, the colors seem to blend into
one tint upon the principle of the persistence of vision; (See
Swain’s experiment. <i>Trans. R. So. Edin.</i> ’49 and ’61.); but when
viewed by the flash of a spark, the colors are seen as distinctly
separated as if the disc were at rest. By calculation, based directly
upon a series of experiments, he found the duration of the
spark to be about .000042 sec. It was discovered also, by the
rotating mirror, that the apparently single spark was composed
of several following each other in quick succession, and he concluded
that the current during the discharge was intermittent.
He considered each of the divisions of the spark as an electric
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>discharge. Prof. Nichols, of Cornell University, and McKittrick
obtained curves indicating the variation of <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> during the
existence of a spark. <i>Trans. Amer. Inst. Elect. Eng.</i> May 20, ’96.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E8a'></a>8<i>a</i>. Feddersen, who used a Leyden jar, modified the experiment
by having high resistances in the circuit through which
the charge was effected. The duration of the spark was found
to be increased. In one experiment, he employed a slender
column of water as the resistance, 9 mm. in length. The spark
endured .0014 second. With a tube of water 180 mm. the duration
was .0183 second. He noticed also that the duration increases
directly with the striking distance and with the electrical
dimensions of the electrical generator. By varying the resistance
of the circuit, he found as it became less, the discharge was
intermittent, when further reduced, <i>continuous</i>, (difficult to obtain)
<a href='#E11'>§ 11</a> and when very small, oscillatory—<i>i.e.</i>, alternately in
opposite directions.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E9'></a>9. <span class='sc'>Faraday’s Experiment. Brush discharge sound.</span> <i>Phil.
Trans.</i> Jan. 1837. <i>Se.</i> XII.—The brush discharge was caused to
occur, in his experiments, generally from a small ball about .7
of an inch in diameter, at the end of a long brass rod, acting as
the anode. With smaller balls he noticed that the pitch of the
sound produced was so much higher as to produce a distinct
musical note, and he suggested that the note could be employed
as a means of counting the number of intermissions per second.
See Mayer’s book on “Sound” § 77, on measuring number of
vibrations in a musical note.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E9a'></a>9<i>a</i>. Upon bringing the hand toward the brush the pitch increased.
<a href='#E49'>§ 49</a>. With still smaller balls and points, in which case
the brush could hardly be distinguishable, the sound was not
heard. He alluded to the rotating mirror of Wheatstone as becoming
not only useful but necessary at this stage. He considered
the brush as the form of discharge between the contact and
the air or else some other non or semi-conductor, but generally
between the conductor and the walls of the room or other objects
which are nearest the electrodes, the air acting as the dielectric.
One experiment, he performed with hydrochloric acid
led him to believe that that particular gas permitted of a dark or
invisible discharge. Sometimes the air was electrically charged
<a href='#E4'>§ 4</a> to a less distance than the length of the brush or light.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E10'></a>10. <span class='sc'>Brush in Different Gases. Striae Cathode Brushes.</span>
In the air, at the ordinary pressure he found the color to be
“purple;” when rarefied still more purple, and then approaching
to rose; in oxygen, at the ordinary pressure, a dull white;
when rarefied, “purple;” and with nitrogen, the color was particularly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>easily obtained at the anode, and when nitrogen was rarefied
the effect was magnificent. The quantity of light was
greater than with any other gas that he tried. Hydrogen, as to its
effect, fell between nitrogen and oxygen. The color was greenish
grey at the ordinary pressure and also at great rarity. The
striae were very fine in form and distinctness, pale in color and
velvety in appearance, but not as beautiful as those in hydrogen.
With coal gas, the brushes were not easily produced. They
were short and strong and generally green, and more like an
ordinary spark. The light was poor and rather grey. Also in
carbonic acid gas the brush was crudely formed at the ordinary
pressure as to the size, light and color. The tendency of the
discharge in this case was always towards the formation of the
spark as distinguished from the brush. When rarefied, the light
was weak, but the brush was better in form and greenish to
purple, varying with the pressure and other circumstances. As
to hydrochloric acid, it was difficult to obtain a brush at the
ordinary pressure. He tried all kinds of rods, balls and points,
and while carrying on all these experiments he kept two other
electrodes out in the air for comparison, and while he could not
obtain any satisfactory brush in the hydrochloric acid gas, there
were simultaneously beautiful brushes in the air. In the rarefied
gas, he obtained striae of a blue color.</p>

<p class='c008'>He compared the appearances also of the anode and cathode
brushes in different gases at different pressures. He noticed
that in air, the superiority of the anode brush was not very marked
(<a href='#E41'>§ 41</a> at end.) In nitrogen, this superiority was greater yet. A
line of theory ran through Faraday’s mind in connection with
all these experiments, whereby he held that there is “A direct
relation of the electric forces with the molecules of the matter
concerned in the action.” <a href='#E47'>§ 47</a>. He made a practical application
of the principles in the explanation of lightning, because
nitrogen gas forms 4/5 of the atmosphere, and as the discharge
takes place therein so easily.</p>

most easily obtained in rarefied air. The electrodes were of
metal rods about .2 of an inch in diameter. He also obtained
a glow in the open air by means of one or both of the small
rods. He noticed some peculiarities of the glow. In the first
place, it occurred in all gases and slightly in oil of turpentine.
It was accompanied by a motion of the gas, either directly from
the light or towards it. He was unable to analyze the glow into
visible elementary intermittent discharges, nor could he obtain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>any evidence of such an intermittent action, <a href='#E8a'>§ 8<i>a</i></a>. No sound
was produced even in open air. <a href='#E9'>§ 9</a>. He was able to change the
brush into a glow by aiding the formation of a current of air at
the extremity of the rod. He also changed the glow into a
brush by a current of air, or by influencing the inductive action
near the glow. The presentation of a sharp point assisted in
sustaining or sometimes even in producing the glow; so also
did rarefaction of the air. The condensation of the air, or the
approach of a large surface tended to change the glow into a
brush, and sometimes into a spark. Greasing the end of the
wire caused the glow to change into a brush.</p>

He placed a piece of cardboard between two electrodes and discovered
that a spark penetrated the material and left a hole
with burnt edges. When the electrodes were not exactly opposite
each other, the perforation occurred in the neighborhood of
the negative pole. Later experiments have shown that a glass
plate, 5 or 6 cm. in thickness, can be punctured by the spark of
a large induction coil. The plate should be large enough to
prevent the spark from going around the edges. The spark is
inclined, also, to spread over the surface of the glass instead of
piercing it, <a href='#E24'>§ 24</a>. Glass has been cracked by the spark in some
experiments.</p>

<i>Nature</i>, Dec. 26, 1879, p. 189. The length of the spark from the
secondary coil in air was 12 cm. One terminal of the secondary
passed through an ebonite plate (18 cm. × 12) and touched the
glass. Olive oil was spread around said terminal (<a href='#E11'>§ 11</a> at end),
and served to insulate the same. Oil dielectric in this connection
originally employed at least prior to 1870. Remembered
by Prof. Anthony as far back as 1872, who often performed the
experiment according to instructions contained in a publication.
The other terminal of the secondary coil was brought against
the glass opposite the first terminal. The spark was then
passed and the glass perforated, <a href='#E12'>§ 12</a>. By pushing the glass
along to successive positions and passing the spark at each
movement, holes could be made very close together. In <i>Nature</i>,
of 1896, the author noticed that certain manufacturers were
introducing glass perforated with invisible holes to be used for
windows as a means of ventilation without strong draughts.
Perhaps the fine holes were made by means of the electric
spark.</p>

would cause the discharge to take place at a lower <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span>, which

the effect of pressure, temperature, etc., and wondered whether
there would be any difference in the law according to what gas
was used. He arranged apparatus so that he could know, with
air as a standard, whether another gas had a greater or less dielectric
power. (Cavendish before him had noticed a difference.)
He tabulated the results. They exhibited the following facts,
namely that gas, when employed as dielectrics, depend for their
power upon their chemical nature. <a href='#E10'>§ 10</a>. Hydrochloric acid gas
was found to have three times the dielectric strength of hydrogen,
and more than twice that of oxygen, nitrogen or air; therefore

Inst. Proc. Brit. Asso.</i>, Aug. 16, ’94. In making comparisons,
things of like nature should be considered. Take, for example,
gas at .01 m. The number of molecules in such a rarefied atmosphere
is comparatively small, while in an electrolyte there
are molecules sufficient in number to produce 15,000 lbs. of
pressure, if imagined in the gaseous state within the same space.
By an experiment and rough calculation, Prof. J. J. Thomson,
F.R.S., calculated that the conductivity of a gas estimated <i>per
molecule</i> is about 10 million times that of an electrolyte, for example,
sulphuric acid. <a href='#E14'>§ 14</a>. This is greater than the molecular
conductivity of the best conducting metals. The experiment
which is illustrated in Fig. <a href='#i010'>IV.</a> was a second experiment which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>did not serve as a basis for calculation, but exhibited very
strikingly to the eye that gases having different pressures have
different conductivities. For this apparatus
he had two concentric bulbs, as
indicated, one being contained within
the other. The inner one had air rarefied
to the luminous point. The outer one
had a vacuum as high as it was practical
to make it, and contained in a projection
a drop of mercury, which, when heated,
would gradually increase the pressure.
Two Leyden jars were employed, and
their outer coatings were connected to
the coil which is seen surrounding the outer bulb, and the inner
coatings were connected to the coils of a Wimshurst machine.
The operation was as follows: When the mercury was cold,
that is, with a high vacuum in the outer compartment, a bright
discharge passed through the <i>inner</i> bulb, while the <i>outer</i> bulb
was dark. When the mercury was heated, the outer bulb was
bright, and the inner one was almost dark. By well-known
principles of conductors and non-conductors, the operation was
explained by Prof. Thomson, who assumed that the gas in the
outer bulb is a conductor; then, at each spark will the alternating
current in the coil induce currents of an opposite direction
in the gas, which will become luminous, as occurred when the
mercury was heated. The currents circulating in the gas act
as a shield to the induction of the currents in the inner bulb.
However, with the vacuum exceedingly high in the outer bulb,
the air therein being a non-conductor comparatively, or for the
given <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span>, does not prevent the discharge through the inner
bulb, which becomes, therefore, luminous. He next compared
the dielectric power of a gas, a liquid and a solid. He found
that the <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> had to be raised, in order to produce the discharge,—higher
in the liquid than in the gas, and higher in the
solid than in the fluid. <a href='#E12'>§ 12</a>.</p>

After the air was exhausted by a mechanical air pump through
a capillary tube, the same was sealed with the flame of a spirit

expands by heat at about the same rate as glass: hence

accurate measurement of dielectric strength, he noticed that
upon placing mica between the electrodes, as is hereinafter
set forth, a spark did not at first form, but that which he called
a corona. He attributed the appearances to a condenser phenomenon,
or at least he suggested this as an explanation. <a href='#E3'>§ 3</a>.
As soon as the corona reached the edge of the plate, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>disruptive discharge took place, by means of the sparks passing
over the edge of the dielectric. <a href='#E38'>§ 38</a>. He employed an alternating
current dynamo of about 50 volts and 1 h.p., frequency
of 150 complete periods per second. The <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> of the alternator
was varied, by changing the exciting current, up to 90
volts. Step-up transformers were employed. With a difference
of potential in the secondary of 830 volts, and a thickness of mica
of 1.8 mm. and when the experiment was performed in a dark
room a faint bluish glow appeared between the mica and the
electrodes. At 970 volts the glow was brighter, while at 1560
volts the luminosity was visible in broad day-light, and kept on
increasing with the increase of <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> He modified the experiment
by using mica of a thickness of 2.3 mcm. The difference
of potential was 4.5 kilo-volts. In addition to the bluish glow,
violet streams or creepers broke out and increased in number
and length as the <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> became greater, forming a kind of
aurora around the electrodes and on both sides of the mica sheet.
A loud hissing noise occurred. <a href='#E9'>§ 9</a>. As soon as the corona
reached the edges of the mica, the disruptive discharge occurred
in the form of intensely white sparks and it was noticeable that
the length of these sparks was 10 fold greater than could be
obtained in the air at 17 kilo-volts. These sparks were so hot
as to oxidize the mica, as apparent from the white marks remaining.
The electrodes also became very hot, and the mica
was contorted and finally broke down.</p>

by an experiment, that when the vacuum is sufficiently
perfect, no electromotive force could drive the spark from one
terminal to the other, however close together they may be. <a href='#E18'>§ 18</a>.
Details of Morgan’s Experiments were as follows, given roughly
in his own words:—A mercurial gauge about fifteen inches long,
carefully and accurately boiled till every particle of air was expelled
from the inside, was coated with tinfoil five inches down
from its sealed end, and being inverted into mercury through a
perforation in the brass cap which covered the mouth of the
cistern, the whole was cemented together and the air was exhausted
from the inside of the cistern, through a valve in the
brass cap, which, producing a perfect vacuum in the gauge, formed
an instrument peculiarly well adapted for experiments of
this kind. Things being thus adjusted (a small wire having
been previously fixed on the inside of the cistern, to form a communication
between the brass cap and the mercury, into which
the gauge was inverted), the coated end was applied to the conductor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>of an electrical machine, and notwithstanding every effort,
neither the smallest ray of light nor the slightest charge
could ever be procured in this exhausted gauge.</p>

resistance adapted to be varied between very wide limits. The
result was a constant potential at the electrodes of the bulb,
during all the variations of the resistance. They concluded,
therefore, that the discharge in highly rarefied gases is disruptive,
the same as in air at ordinary pressure.</p>

Tube Current in Secondary of Ruhmkorff Coil.</span> <i>Translated
from the German, by Ludwig Gutmann. Extract of paper read by G.
Klingenberg before the Electro-technischer Verein.</i> It would naturally
be inferred that an induction coil, the primary current of
which is intermitted, and of one direction, would produce an
alternating current in the secondary coil. The fact of the matter
is, however, that a good induction coil will produce the sparking
only in but one direction. <a href='#E41'>§ 41</a>. The reason is the following: If the
coil had no self-induction nor capacity, then the current impulses
would be represented by a rectangle <i>a</i>, Fig. <a href='#i013'>1</a>. On closing, the
current would suddenly reach its maximum, which is determined
by the terminal pressure and circuit resistance, and this
current strength would be maintained as long as the circuit remained
closed. On the opening of the circuit, the current would
decrease just as suddenly; if not, the arc on opening of the circuit
would oppose such sudden fall, therefore the corner will be
slightly rounded at <i>a</i>, Fig. <a href='#i013'>2</a>. The influence of self-induction,
which we find in any coil, is the force that will tend to oppose
any change in the current strength. Therefore, the self-induction
will be the cause of a retardation of the minimum current.
On the other hand, it increases the size of the spark on opening.
Next a condenser is enclosed in the main circuit, so that the
spool is closed through it at the moment the current is intercepted.
If we assume, for simplicity sake, that the magnetization
of the iron is proportional to the current strength, then the
primary current curve represents at the same time, the curve of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the rate of change of line of force in the magnetic field. The
secondary <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> is determined by e =
<i>n</i>(<i>dw</i>/<i>dt</i>)<i>t</i> <i>t</i>; the rise then
will have a smaller <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> than at the fall, like Fig. <a href='#i013'>3</a>,

the mercury would move along through a capillary tube, having
a scale so that the amount could be represented to the eye, as in
the cut. (Fig. <a href='#i014'>V.</a>) The experiments proved that when a spark
passes through the air, the pressure is
increased, and it was concluded in view
of several experiments, that the spark
being the source of an intense, but small
amount of heat, expanded the air, thereby
causing the pressure in a secondary
manner, through the agency of heat. A
spark as short as 2 mm. will produce a
considerable pressure of the mercury. Riess performed an experiment
also in causing the spark to pass through cardboard,
and also through mica located within the air chamber. <a href='#E12'>§ 12</a>.
Other things being equal, the increase of temperature was less
by using the solid material like mica or cards, than without.
This illustrated that a part of the energy of the spark was converted
into heat and a part into mechanical force, and explained
why sound, <a href='#E24'>§ 24</a>, is produced by a spark and by lightning.</p>

of light extended from one end of the magnet pole to the other,
and remained stationary, while the magnet was not energized;
but the light was condensed into an arc and travelled around the

<p class='c013'><a id='E31'></a>31. <span class='sc'>Thomson’s Experiment. A Discharge Retarded Across
and Accelerated Along the Lines of Magnetic Force.</span>
<i>Nature</i>, Lon., Jan. 31, 1895, p. 333. <i>Lect. Royal Inst.</i>—Prof. J. J.
Thomson, F. R. S., performed an experiment which illustrates
that the electrical discharge is retarded in flowing across the
lines of magnetic force and accelerated in flowing with or parallel
to such lines. As illustrated in Fig. 20, p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>, he employed a
large electro-magnet adapted to be cut in and out of circuit. He
had two air chambers, one a bulb, indicated by a circle, and the
other a tube bent into a rectangle, indicated by the dotted square.
Between these, was an adjustable coil having its terminals connected
to the outside coatings of Leyden jars. When the discharge
took place between the poles of the magnet, that is, in
the direction of the lines of force, the discharge was helped along
by the magnetic field, but when it took place across the bulb,
that is, across the lines of force, the discharge was retarded.
“The coil can be adjusted so that when the magnet is ‘off’ the
discharge passes through the bulb, but not round the square
tube; when, however, the magnet is ‘on,’ the discharge passes
in the square tube but not in the bulb.”</p>

’95, p. 333.—It has often been remarked that lightning always
takes the easiest path. The same has been noticed with references
to the artificial electric spark. Prof. J. J. Thomson, F.R.S.
performed an experiment, which not only confirms this principle
but does so in an emphatic manner, and proves it true in reference
to the electric discharge in rarefied gases. He arranged
a very thin platinum diaphragm so as to divide a Geissler tube
into two compartments, Fig. 19, p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>. He then formed a passage
way around the diaphragm, which could be opened and
closed by mercury, by respectively lowering and raising the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>lower vessel of mercury along the barometer tube. When the
passage way is opened around the diaphragm, the luminosity
extends through the passage way in preference to going through
the diaphragm. When the passage way is closed by mercury,
the discharge goes through the thin metal plate. The same was
found to occur when the platinum leaf was replaced by a mica
scale.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='E36a'></a>36<i>a</i>. <span class='sc'>Hammer’s Photo-Electric Dust Figures.</span> <i>From personal
interview.</i>—According to experiments of Elster and Geitel,
hereinafter noted, <a href='#E98'>§ 98</a>, Hammer’s dust figures shown in the
accompanying half-tone cut may possibly be accounted for on
the principle of the discharge of negatively electrified bodies by
light. Mr. William J. Hammer, <i>Mem. Amer. Inst. Elect. Eng.</i>, has
a historical collection of incandescent lamps (<i>Elect. Eng.</i>, N.Y.,
April 29, ’96, p. 446.) which were arranged on shelves in a glass
case standing obliquely in the sunlight about an hour a day. After
the lapse of many months, the very fine dust within the case
lodged upon the inner surface of the glass in such a manner as
to produce oval dust figures corresponding somewhat to the
shapes of the lamps and some of them, appear after reproduction
by the half-tone process in the accompanying cut. When the
figures are inspected closely and the circumstances are known,
no one can doubt that the sun and lamps acted as agents in their
formation. As to the correct explanation, the matter has not been
sufficiently discussed by scientists (presented here for the first
time) to enable the author to render the opinions of others,
but it is of interest in connection with Roentgen rays and the
discharge of electrified bodies by light. As a matter of course,
the surfaces of the lamps would reflect the light in such a way
as to make bright spots (movable, however, with the sun) upon
the glass of the containing case, and if the latter were in any
sense charged by negative atmospheric electricity, this light
would cause a variable amount of dust to be attracted according
to the intensity of the rays striking the glass. These remarks
are in the nature merely of a suggestion of a hypothesis. The
heavy curved black line in the cut is a part of the frame of
the glass case. The incandescent lamps do not show, simply
because the case was empty when the photograph was taken.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>That the figures were not due to chemical action was shown
by rubbing off some of the dust with the fingers. Finger marks
were pictured on the figures. Off hand, Mr. Hammer and Prof.
Anthony intimate air convection by differentiation of temperature,
as a possible cause.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span><a id='E36b'></a>36<i>b</i>. Independently of the above peculiar phenomenon, Mr.
Hammer recently had on exhibition at the Electrical Exposition
of the National Electric Light Association in New York, 1896,
a portrait formed of fine dust upon a pane of glass. The circumstances
were as follows, as remembered by the author. Mr.
Hammer happened to be in some place where an artisan was
removing a photograph from an old frame. The glass which
protected the portrait exhibited a fac-simile in dust on the inner
surface. The glass had not been in contact with the photograph,
because of a thick passe-partout surrounding the picture.
Neither was the glass an old negative photographic plate.
Further test and inspection tended to prove that the dust picture
was executed by some action of the heat or light of the sun.
Prof. Benjamin F. Thomas, of the University of the State of
Ohio, in an interview, scarcely thought that the result was due
to convection, because the dust print was so sharply defined.
The principle of the discharge of bodies by light may be applicable
perhaps, but further experiment would be necessary as a
more secure foundation. It is common to find the print of a
picture in a book upon the opposite page, being due merely to
the pressure of the inked surface, as in the art of printing. This
explanation cannot be applied to the dust portrait, because there
was no contact between the photograph and the glass.</p>

First, a metal plate suitably insulated; secondly, a piece of a

metal object on top of the glass. Sparks were then allowed to
pass for several minutes from a Holtz or similar machine to the
coin. The image of the latter appeared by removing the glass
plate and breathing upon it. The bas-relief of the image on the
coin also was visible in all its details, appearing as in Sanford’s
Electrograph, <a href='#E35'>§ 35</a>. Theoretical considerations led others to
believe that the figures of Riess and Karsten are due to a different
cause from that involved in the figures of Lichtenberg, for
the former are thought to be due to a molecular action of a
permanent nature upon an insulating material. A slight change
in the color often occurs, thereby outlining the object.</p>

Notes by Request.</span> April, 1896.—Although this experiment
does not belong to that class connected with discharge
tubes, yet the phenomenon has a theoretical interest in connection
with X-rays. He obtained a photograph of different objects
in the dark by means of radiations from the poles of an
electro-magnet after two hours’ exposure, but it need not have
been so long, as he obtained clear images in five minutes in one
experiment with frequent variations of current by means of a
rheostat, and by approach and recession of the armature. The
elements involved in the experiment were arranged in the following
order: First, a large inverted magnet for supporting 100
lbs., the poles hanging downward. Next in order was a wooden
board pressing flatwise against the ends of the poles of the
magnet. Next, the objects and the sensitive plates backed
thereby and all enclosed in a completely opaque wrapping extending
over the sides, face, back, etc., of these two elements.
Next in order was an armature about as heavy as the magnet
would support. The cut herein represents the photograph that
was produced of the different objects named. By reading Prof.
McKay’s very detailed description in the <i>Scientific American</i>,
April 18, 1896, p. 249, the reader may feel certain that the photograph
was not due to light for he tried the experiments in
different ways and with various precautions. In a course of experiments
carried on by student Austin, about Feb. 15, ’96, in
the Dartmouth laboratory, a sciagraph of what appeared to be
the lines of force was obtained by means of X-rays, but upon
repeating the experiment the result was negative. See <i>Elect.

understood, imagine a tube standing vertically in another tube.
The two concentric tubes communicate with each other at the
top only. The Holtz machine is the generator. The liquids in the
two tubes at the beginning stand at the same level. Sparks are
passed through the adjacent air, which is in contact with both
liquids. The liquid at the cathode rises and at the anode falls.
<a href='#E38'>§ 38</a>. Such was the experiment performed by Gernez. He was
inclined to conclude that the effect was due to “An electrical
transport of liquids along the moistened surfaces of the tubes.”
When the liquid was alcohol, it actually went over as by distillation,
three times as fast as water. A soluble salt in water increased
the rate of distillation; and so also did the addition of a
small quantity of sulphuric acid or ammonia. No distillation
of bi-sulphide of carbon, tetra chloride of carbon, nor turpentine
occurred. Query: Can alcohol be concentrated or practically

confirmed by Sir David Solomons, Bart. <i>Proc. Royal So.</i>,
June 21, ’94. <i>Nature</i>, Lon., Sept. 13, ’94, p. 490. He obtained
in the vacuum luminosity with 500 Daniell’s cells, which he
found to be the least <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> that could be employed. He
omitted, and apparently overlooked, the introduction of an automatic
interrupter in the circuit and the use of a very low
<span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> <a href='#E52'>§ 52</a>. In conjunction with Spottiswoode, 1,080 cells of
chloride of silver (about 2,000 volts) were employed, first without,
and then with condensers. One of the condensers consisted
of the usual tinfoil type, and the other of a self-induction kind,
namely of about 1,000 feet of wire. The results were striae
with the condensers, and no striae without the condensers. <a href='#E8a'>§ 8<i>a</i></a>.
The results suggested to them that there was some relation in
principle between the striae and vibration of the current. They
therefore built an ingenious apparatus to test whether this was
true or not, and they found such was the case by the following
related means. If a current passing directly from the primary
battery through the condenser and the discharge tube is undulatory
or intermittent in any sense, then it would be able to induce
a current in the secondary of the induction coil. <a href='#E8'>§ 8</a> at
centre. They found that there was a current thus induced, and
they detected it by means of a small discharge tube which became
luminous. Fig. 3 p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>. This was an independent tube
near the top of the figure, having nothing to do with the one
containing striae, which were produced by the primary current
and shown at the right. Dr. Oliver Lodge, F.R.S., in treating
of the cathode and X-rays in <i>The Elect.</i>, Lon., Jan. 31,

<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>“In the days of Gassiot and other early workers
(<a href='#E43'>§ 43</a>) on the discharge in rarefied air, it was the stream from

at nearly every scientific conversazione.”</p>

vol. x., 1855, p. 203-207.—Imagine an electric bell vibrator and
magnet within the glass receiver upon an air pump. Upon
connecting the magnet and vibrator in series with a small electric
battery, it is evident that in the open air, as usual in electric
bells, there will be a minute violet spark at the terminals of the
circuit breaker. <a href='#E6'>§ 6</a>. Now, let the air be exhausted as far as
possible by means of a mechanical pump as constructed in 1855.
Poggendorff performed such an experiment, and he noticed that
in the poor vacuum the ordinary violet spark became yellow,
while blue light like a small enveloping tube surrounded the
hammer of the vibrator and wire leading to the opposite contact
and a little projection extending away from the hammer.
His experiment was unique, because showing for the first time
that a current from a battery, if interrupted in the vacuum, will
not only produce the usual minute spark, but that a blue tube
of light will be produced around the conductors within the vacuum.</p>

Striae at the Anode. Number of Striae Varied by Change
of Current.</span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1878.—By an arrangement of means
for causing different pressures, they made a discovery, namely,
that as far as the eye is concerned the striae begin to have their
existence at the anode. <a href='#E46'>§ 46</a>. Imagine the internal gas pressure
to become less and less. First, a violet luminosity occurs
around the anode as in <a href='#E42'>§ 42</a>. As the pressure becomes less and
less, luminous striae move toward the cathode accompanied by
more and more striae, which increase either to form a column
reaching a certain distance or else extending through the whole
distance between the electrodes. <a href='#E46'>§ 46</a>. They observed that
when the <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> was constant and the current changed, the
variation in the appearance of the striae was very regular. <a href='#E41'>§ 41</a>.
With some tubes the number of striae increased with the increase
of current, while with a decrease of current the number
of striae became less and less. <a href='#E8a'>§ 8<i>a</i></a>. With some tubes the number
of striae increased while the current decreased. <a href='#E8a'>§ 8<i>a</i></a>. With
the use of a condenser, then as the <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> decreased together
with a diminution of current, the number of striae varied. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>striae nearest the anode vanished first, as they diminished in
number with the fall of the <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> The striae on the other
hand originated at the anode, when the charge of the condenser
was gradually increased from a minimum, and then the striae
continued to increase from the anode as the source. As to the
color of the striae, the same was changed by an alteration of
the current.</p>

455.—Spottiswoode found that he could obtain motion when he
desired. He introduced some constant resistances and also a
rheostat of fine adjustment. The least change of resistance
caused some effect upon the striae. The general principle that
he established was that letting it be assumed that the striae are
stationary then; “An increase of resistance produces a forward
flow, and a decrease of the resistance a backward flow,” differences
of as little as 1 ohm in the primary current caused the
effect. Sometimes the velocity of the flow is fast and sometimes
slow, being so rapid in certain instances that the unaided eye
cannot distinguish them, but they are known to exist by the
use of the revolving mirror. <a href='#E46'>§ 46</a>. With tubes of small diameter,
compared with their length, he noticed the fact that the striae
in one portion of the tube moved faster than those in another
portion. <a href='#E46'>§ 46</a>. Sometimes one group moved while the other one
was stationary. Sometimes they moved in opposite directions.
This last named phenomenon occurred also in very wide tubes.
The points at which the charge took place he called nodes. He
discovered external means for stopping this action. He did it
by means of a magnet located opposite one end of the tube. <a href='#E31'>§ 31</a>.
When the magnet was energized, all motion ceased. <a href='#E31'>§ 31</a>.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='E46'></a>46. <span class='sc'>Thomson’s Experiment. Velocity of Striae Checked
at the Cathode.</span> <i>Nature</i>, Lon. Jan. 31, ’96, p. 330.—A tube
50 ft. long was exhausted, <a href='#E8a'>§ 8<i>a</i></a>., as to striking distance. In this
particular experiment, he caused a single interruption in the
primary of the induction coil, and observed the motion of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>striae from the anode to the cathode by means of a rotating
mirror. <a href='#E43'>§ 43</a>. The luminosity began at the anode and travelled
toward the negative with a high velocity, but upon its arrival at
the negative pole its velocity was checked. He said that the
striae did not disappear at the cathode like a rabbit would in
entering a hole, but they lingered around the electrode for some
time. As a consequence of this delay, he found as expected, an
accumulation of positive electricity, <a href='#E4'>§ 4</a>, in the neighborhood of
the cathode. It is a general principle, therefore, that when a
discharge passes between a gas and metal, there is an accumulation,
illustrating that the discharge experiences a difficulty or
resistance. <a href='#E32'>§ 32</a> and <a href='#E33'>33</a>. The experimenter, Prof. J. J. Thomson,
acknowledged that Profs. Liveing and Davy had noticed similar
effects.</p>

Electrolysis.</span> <i>Nature</i>, Lon. Jan. 31, ’95. <i>Lect. S. Inst. The
Electr.</i>, Lon. vol. 31, p. 291, 316, and vol. 35, p. 578. <i>Trans. R.
So.</i>, ’95.—The discharge of electricity through conducting liquids
is, with scarcely an exception, (example, mercury) accompanied
by a chemical action. Faraday and Davy both performed early
experiments in this direction. Prof. J. J. Thomson has set
forth some instructive facts and which act as evidence that there
is a close relation between the disruptive discharge and chemical
action between the dielectric and electrodes. <a href='#E6'>§ 6</a> and <a href='#E7'>7</a>. He
made this experiment in connection with his investigations
relating to the difficulty the positive electricity experiences in
passing from a gas to the negative electrode. <a href='#E46'>§ 46</a>. He carried
this experiment further, by testing gases of different chemical
natures. The apparatus he employed consisted first of an alternating
current generator, a high tension converter, a bulb for
containing first one gas and then another, whose metal electrodes
were connected with the secondary of the transformer, and an
electrometer connected to a third electrode which could be
moved about within the bulb. The operation was as follows:
when the bulb contained oxygen which is an electro-negative
gas, the third movable electrode received a positive charge in
whatever part of the bulb it was moved to, but with hydrogen
instead of oxygen at atmospheric pressure, the third electrode
received a positive charge far away from the arc between the
other electrodes, but very near the arc it received a negative
charge. He then rarefied the atmosphere of hydrogen and he
noticed that the space where the third electrode became negative,
contracted, and at about 1/3 of an atmosphere became practically
nothing, so that the said third electrode connected to the electrometer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>became slightly positive at all points within the hydrogen.
<a href='#E4'>§ 4</a>. The next step consisted in using a bulb, having oxydized
copper electrodes and a hydrogen atmosphere at the pressure
where there was only positive electricity, that is about 1/3 of an
atmosphere. This remarkable phenomenon occurred; there was
no positive electricity, but only negative. When the copper
oxide was reduced, the positive electricity only, existed in all
parts of the bulb. In brief, bright copper electrodes left a positive
charge in the gas, while oxydized electrodes left a negative
charge. He argued upon the results of this experiment to
account for the delay in the passage of the electricity from the
gas to the metal, <a href='#E46'>§ 46</a>. In later experiments, he used the spectroscope
to detect decomposition. <a href='#E6'>§ 6</a>, at end.</p>

with a wide, dark interval. <a href='#E44'>§ 44</a>. They found that the
heat was greatest at the position of maximum luminosity, but
they also found that heat was generated at the dark spaces. A
novel feature was the discovery of the development of heat in
the middle of the tube even when there was no luminosity, <a href='#E9a'>§ 9<i>a</i></a>,
near end, so that they thought it probable there may be what
might be termed heat striae, independently of luminous striae.</p>

State. Air-Gap in Circuit Forms Best Method of Obtaining.
Branch Current to Earth Verified by a Telephone.
Sensitive State by a Single Quick Discharge.</span> <i>Phil. Trans.</i>,
1879, p. 165, and April 8, 1880.—By sensitive state of luminous
effects in a Geissler tube is meant the susceptibility of the light
(<a href='#E28'>§ 28</a>) to an outside conductor connected to earth. Fig. 5, p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>.
When one’s hand is brought near a Geissler tube the change
near the hand sometimes occurs and sometimes it does not. <a href='#E8'>§ 8</a>.
In the first place, the effect is more easily noticeable if the vacuum
tube is comparatively wide or thick in diameter. With the
electric egg, for example, the luminous effect, instead of extending
more or less across the space between the electrodes, reaches
from one of the poles to a conductor on the outside of the egg,
provided said conductor has an earth connection or large capacity.
Some of the light continues to exist nevertheless between
the two poles. The general principle is that the division exists
because of the re-distribution or branching of the disruptive discharge.
It was not known why the luminosity should be affected
by such an outside conductor sometimes, and remain the same at
other times but the above named experimenters discovered causes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>which could be depended upon to produce the sensitive state.
The apparatus will be described. They had the usual Geissler
tube with the platinum wire electrodes, and a Holtz machine as
the generator. They were led to believe that intermissions of
the current had a great deal to do with the production of the
sensitive state, and accordingly they arranged for an air-gap in
circuit with the machine and with the vacuum tube. <a href='#E51'>§ 51</a>.
They not only observed that such a gap caused the sensitive
state, but that an increase in the length of the gap made the luminous
column more sensitive. They increased the gap so
much that the ramifications of the light could be seen. If an
induction coil is employed as the secondary generator, a condenser
should be coupled up in connection with it. The two in
combination thereby produce the sensitive state, but upon cutting
out the coil and charging the tubes from the condenser the
sensitiveness can not be detected. Instead of the permanent
air-gap, may be employed a rapid circuit interrupter, coupled up
between a Holtz machine and a vacuum tube. The manner of
coupling up is to place the interrupter in a shunt to the vacuum
tube. Difficulty had been found in early experiments to obtain
the sensitive state with those vacua which give striae. With a
rapid circuit interrupter and an induction coil, the breaks occurring
240 per second, the luminous column was not only
broken up into striae, but were acted upon by the approach of
an outside conductor connected to earth. The sensitive state is
not always made apparent by the appearance of attraction of
the luminous light to the outside conductor. Sometimes the
light seems to be repelled. These two phenomena may be
caused in the same tube. This feature of the sensitive state
constitutes the beginning of radiations of energy through the
walls of a vacuum bulb, like X-rays. Some action or other in
these cases takes place through the glass. They tried an experiment
in which one of the electrodes of the vacuum tube was
entirely on the outside. The electrical discharge was found to
be sensitive, for the discharge was changed in its appearances by
the presence of an outside conductor connected to earth. Another
cause of the sensitive state was observed, namely, the
brevity of the charge. This may be illustrated with a Leyden
jar, which is known to give an almost practically instantaneous
discharge. A single discharge from such a jar produced a flash
of light which was in the sensitive state. The nomenclature by
which the experimenters defined the cause of the phenomena is
made up of the words: Re-distribution of electricity, and a relief
of the external strain.</p>
<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span><a id='E49a'></a>49<i>a.</i> No re-distribution took place unless the outside conductor
was connected to earth or to a conductor of large capacity,
nor would an outside conductor, which was already charged,
serve to exhibit the sensitive state. The re-distribution effect
was proved by means of a telephone connected in circuit between
the outside conductor and the earth Fig. 5, p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>. When the
state was sensitive, that is, during the use of the air-gap, the
telephone produced a sound in unison with the intermissions
occurring at the air-gap. <a href='#E9'>§ 9</a> and <a href='#E9a'>9<i>a</i></a>.</p>

State Illustrated by a Flexible Conductor Within the
Discharge Tube.</span> <i>Proc. Vienna Acad.</i>, 1879. <i>Nature</i>, Nov. 20,
1879.—The discharge tube was 20 cm. long. It had the usual
platinum electrodes, and it stood upright. From the upper
electrode, was suspended a strip of tinfoil in the middle of the
tube, which was connected to a pump so that the density of the
gas could be varied. At atmospheric pressure, the secondary
current of a Ruhmkorff coil connected to the electrodes caused
the strip to be attracted to the glass tube. The attraction was
less and less as the process of exhaustion was carried on, and
when a pressure indicated by 7 mm. was reached, the strip was
neither attracted nor repelled, but hung downward the same as
without any electricity whatever, but it was <i>attracted</i> by a neighboring
shell-lac rod which had been rubbed with cloth, and it
was <i>repelled</i> by a glass rod which had been rubbed with amalgam,
it being assumed that the strip was connected to the anode.
§ <a href='#E36'>36</a>. The opposite action took place when it was connected to
the cathode. As the exhaustion continued and became greater
and greater, these actions died away also up to a rarefaction of
about 4 mm. Independently of the degree of rarefaction, the
flexible strip of tinfoil was always deflected by an outside conductor
connected to earth. <a href='#E49'>§ 49</a>.</p>

May 20, ’96, p. 263.—By the U. S. Patent Office he was granted,
among other claims, the following: “The improvement in the
art of electric lighting herein described, which consists in generating
and producing for the operation of lighting devices,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>currents of enormous frequency and excessively high potential,
substantially as herein described.” A simple combination of
circuits together with great skill in the construction of apparatus
involving high powers of insulation, resulted in the production,
within a vacuum, of an electrode radiating intensely white
light. The circuit may be easily traced in the diagram Fig. 17
p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>. Briefly described, there may be noticed an alternating
current generator of comparatively low <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> The current
from this generates a secondary current by means of an induction
coil. This secondary current generates a tertiary current
by a second induction coil. An air-gap for automatic and intermittent
disruptive discharges, <a href='#E49'>§ 49</a> near end, is in the circuit of
the secondary coil of the first named induction coil, which is
directly charged by the alternating current generator. The gap
may be noticed between the two balls. In shunt to the air-gap
is a condenser (see Fizeau, chapter I.) represented by several
parallel lines. The lamp consists merely of an evacuated bulb
having an electrode of carbon or other refractory material,
which is connected to one pole of the last secondary coil while
the other pole may be outside, and may consist, for example,
of the walls of a room, which in such a case should be of some
electric conducting material. The higher the vacuum the more
intense the light; he found no limit to this rule. Fig. 16<i>a</i> p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>
illustrates his ideal method of lighting a room. He found that
with two plates at a distance apart as indicated and connected
to the poles of the coil, and with electrodeless vacuum bulbs,
the latter became bright in space—no mechanical or electrical
connection other than air and the assumed ether.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E52'></a>52. <span class='sc'>Moore’s Experiment. Luminosity in Discharge Tube
by Self-induced Currents.</span> <i>Trans. Amer. Inst. Elect. Eng.</i>, Sept.
20, ’93 and April 22, ’96. <i>Several U. S. Letters Patent.</i> Invented
1892.—During or about 1831, Prof. Henry discovered that when
the circuit of a primary battery was interrupted, a self-induced
current, which he called an extra current, was produced. When
the circuit was closed, there was also a self-induced current, but
very much feebler than that obtained on interruption. The
self-induced current occurred only at or about the instant of
interruption or completion. He found also that the self-induced
current produced by interruption was enormously increased in
<span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> if the circuit included a helix of very long and fine wire.
It was further increased by the presence of an iron core. With
one or two cells, the spark upon interruption was scarcely visible,
but with a fine wire 30 or 40 feet long, an appreciable
spark was obtained during interruption. With but a comparatively
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>few cells, and with a magnet for example like a telegraph
relay, the <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> arose to several thousand volts at the instant of
interruption. D. McFarland Moore introduced into such a circuit
a Geissler tube and provided a rapid automatic interrupter. Page,
Ruhmkorff and others had, at an early date, noticed the desirability,
in operating Geissler tubes by secondary currents, to
obtain quick interruption in the primary circuit in order to produce
the best effects in the Geissler tube. Moore caused the
interruptions to take place in a vacuum, so high that a disruptive
electrical discharge could not pass. The break was therefore,
absolutely instantaneous and complete. By this system, illustrated
in diagram in Fig. 18, p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>, he obtained all the luminous
effects, actions by magnets, the sensitive state, striae and all the
other phenomena heretofore noticed in Geissler tubes and some
of those obtained by Tesla with his apparatus as just described.
In greater detail, it will be noticed that he had a dynamo of rather
low <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span>, generally 100 volts, and a high vacuum containing a
circuit interrupter operated automatically by a magnet outside
like a vibrator in an electric bell. The magnet served also as
the self inductive device. The magnet and interrupter were in
series with each other, therefore, while the Geissler tube was in
series with the magnet, and the electrodes extended either
inside of the Geissler tube or remained on the outside. He performed
numerous experiments on similar lines and developed
the system on a large scale, whereby rooms (e.g. the hall of the
<i>Amer. So. Mech. Eng.</i>, N.Y.) have been illuminated as if by other
artificial illuminants, by employing long and numerous vacuum
tubes. Among several discoveries was that of the production
of a bright pencil of light along the axis of a long open helix,
which formed one of the internal electrodes. The Patent Office
made strenuous efforts to determine the degree of novelty,
assuming that some one else must have conceived the idea of
employing a self-induced current to operate Geissler tubes; but
nothing nearer than Poggendorff’s experiment <a href='#E42'>§ 42</a> could be
found, and therefore the following claim (in patent 548576, Oct.
22, ’95,) was granted among a hundred or so relating to developments
and details and particularly covering the vacuum interrupter.
“The method of producing luminous effects, consisting
in converting a current of low potential into one of high potential,
by rapidly and repeatedly interrupting the low potential
current in its passage through a self-inductive resistance, and
passing the former current through a Geissler tube, thereby
producing light within the tube.”</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='E53'></a>53. <span class='sc'>Crookes’ Experiment. Dark Space Around the Cathode.</span>
<i>Lect. Brit. Asso., Shef., Eng.</i>, Aug. 22, ’79.—According to
Lenard (<i>The Electr., Lond.</i>, Mar. 23, ’94) Hittorf discovered the
cathode rays, and Varley, <a href='#E61a'>§ 61<i>a</i></a>., and Crookes studied them.
The pressure of the residual gas was 1 M. of an atmosphere.
Prof. Crookes, F.R.S., maintained the evacuated space in communication
with the air pump and with an absorbent material.
Before his time most experimenters worked with a vacuum not
much less than 30,000 M. The first experiment is illustrated in
diagram, at Fig. 6 p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>, but the vacuum was not the highest in
this type. The tube was cylindrical and was provided with
electrodes at the ends. Another electrode was located at the
centre and was made the cathode, while the two terminal electrodes
were made the same pole; namely, the anode. Upon
connecting the tube in circuit with the secondary of a large induction
coil, the luminosity did not extend either continuously
or in striae throughout the length of the tube. Former investigators
had likewise noticed the dark space. The space and glass
on each side of the central cathode were dark. The dark space
extended for about one inch on each side of the negative pole.
It is not intended here, any more than in former cases, to present
theories in explanation further than to briefly allude to any conclusion
at which the experimenter himself arrived. Crookes’
explanation of the phenomena has not been universally accepted,
nor has it been proved otherwise. The knowledge of the existence
of rays, now known as Roentgen rays, will assist in formulating
theories upon the Crookes’ phenomena and may either
confirm some of his views or overthrow them. Crookes considered
that the residual atmosphere was in such a state as to
be as different in its properties from gas, as gas is from liquid
and liquid from solid, and therefore he named the attenuated
atmosphere radiant matter, or fourth state of matter. He concluded
that the remaining particles of the gas forming the
radiant matter moved in straight lines over a great distance as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>compared with that moved through by molecules at the ordinary
pressure. He called this distance the “mean free path.” If
his theory is correct, this dark space is due to the fact that the
molecules in motion at and near the cathode do not bombard
each other and therefore do not produce the effect of light.
When the motion is arrested by particles of gas themselves,
within the bulb, then is light generated. The force propelling
the particles from the positive pole was supposed to be less. In
order to let the experiments speak for themselves, as much as
possible, without being too much influenced by the opinion of
the experimenter; the theory is only briefly alluded to as above,
and will not be further applied in the presentation of his other
experiments. In view of the radical discoveries of Lenard and
Roentgen, after the installation of the Crookes phenomena, it
has been the policy of the author to present all the experiments
as facts for evidence in behalf of the general theories, which
may be hereafter formulated independently of old theories.
Therefore, the reader should bear in mind the teachings of the
various experiments with the view of arriving at general principles
and hypotheses.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E54'></a>54. <span class='sc'>Relation of Vacuum to Phosphorescence.</span>—He started
with such a high vacuum that he could not obtain any electrical
discharge. <a href='#E25'>§ 25</a>. There was, therefore, no phosphorescence in
the glass tube, whatever. The caustic potash, which had been
employed to absorb the last trace of moisture and carbonic acid
gas, was slightly heated, and very gradually. Then it was noticed
that a current began to pass and that the glass became
green, and apparently on the inner surface. As the heat continued,
the green passed gradually away and was replaced by
striae, which first appeared to extend across the whole diameter
of the glass tube (<a href='#E40'>§ 40</a>) which was a long cylindrical tube, and
then became concentrated toward the axial line of the tube.
Finally, the light consisted of a pencil of purple. <a href='#E10'>§ 10</a>. When
the source of heat was removed so that the moisture and carbonic
acid gas could be absorbed again by the potash, the striae
appeared, and then the other effects just named, only in the reversed
order, until the tube acted like an infinite resistance.
Phosphorescence is the correct word, because the light existed
for a few seconds after cutting off the current.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E55'></a>55. <span class='sc'>Phosphorescence of Objects Within the Vacuum
Tube.</span>—The construction in Fig. 7, p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>, shows how a diamond
was caused to phosphoresce within a Crookes’ tube, being supported
in a convenient manner in the centre of one of the tubes,
while electrodes were located near the ends and were formed of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>disks facing the diamond. Upon connecting the disks to the
respective poles of the secondary conductor, and by performing
the experiment in a rather dark room, the diamond became
brilliantly phosphorescent, radiating light in all directions. He
experimented with many substances in this way, but found that
the diamond was the best—almost equal to one candle power.
In order to exhibit the phosphorescence of glass in a striking
manner, he charged three small tubes simultaneously. One
was made of uranium glass which radiated a green light. Another
was an English glass which appeared blue, and the remaining
one was German glass which phosphoresced a bright
green. Notice difference with respect to light which does not
perceptibly cause phosphorescence of glass. The uranium glass
was the most luminous. Luminous paint, as prepared by
Becquerel, and later by Balmain, which has the property of
storing up light and afterwards radiating it in a dark room for
several hours, became more phosphorescent in the Crookes tube
than when subject to day-light. Phosphorescence of the mineral
phenakite, the chemical name of which is glucinic aluminate,
was blue, the emerald, crimson, and spodumene, which is a
double silicate, were yellow. The ruby phosphoresced red,
whatever its tint by day-light. In one tube he had rubies of all
the usual tints by day-light, but they were all of one shade of
red by the action of the disruptive discharge in the tube.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E56'></a>56. <span class='sc'>Darkness and Luminosity in Arms of V Tube.</span> See Fig.
8, p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>. It will be noticed that in Fig. 6, p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>, the tube was
straight. Crookes desired to see what effect would take place
in a bent tube. He therefore employed a V shaped tube, having
electrodes in the ends—one in each arm. Upon causing the
electrical discharge to take place through the tube, one arm was
luminous and the other was dark. Whatever the <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> was,
the appearances remained the same. No luminosity would bend
from one arm of the V shaped tube to the other. The cathode
arm was always luminous and the anode dark. With a less degree
of vacuum, both arms were luminous, according to early
experimenters who thus brilliantly lighted tubes of the most
fantastic shapes.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E57'></a>57. <span class='sc'>Cathode Rays Rectilinear. Radiate Normally From
the Surface of the Cathode.</span> In his lecture he had, side by
side, two bulbs, one, in which the vacuum was of such a degree,
that a blue stream of light existed between the negative pole
and positive pole, <a href='#E54'>§ 54</a>, at centre. It is evident that the vacuum
in this bulb was not very high. Fig. 9, p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>, shows a stream
extending from the negative to the positive pole, Fig. 10, p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>is the same kind of a tube only the vacuum is about 1 to 2 m.
In other words, the vacuum in the latter was just so high that a
discharge took place, and instead of the luminous effect being
like that with a low vacuum, there was a patch of green light
directly opposite the concave negative pole. The radiations from
this pole were rectilinear, crossing each other at a focus within
the bulb and producing upon the glass a phosphorescent spot.
It should be remembered that the word radiations is used as a
mere matter of convenience. Directly opposite the concave
cathode, there was a green patch of light on the inner surface of
the glass. It was shown that it made no difference where the anode
was. This fact becomes useful in carrying on experiments
in connection with Roentgen rays, and it may have a great deal
to do with the solution of the theoretical problems in connection
with electrical discharges in vacuum tubes. In regard to the
three streams shown in Fig. 9, p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>, it may be stated that only
one occurred at a time in the experiment, for, first one anode
was connected in circuit, and then the next by itself, and then
the third one by itself, while the concave pole was always negative.
Each time the anode was changed, the stream changed,
and connected that pole which was in circuit, <a href='#E43'>§ 43</a>, but similar
changes made upon the tube with a high vacuum, did not alter
the position of the phosphorescent spot. This and other experiments
show that the radiations took place perpendicularly from
the surface of the cathode.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E58'></a>58. <span class='sc'>Shadow Cast Within the Discharge Tube.</span> This is
illustrated in Fig. 11, p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>, where there is a negative polar disk
at the small end of the egg shaped tube, and a cross near the
large end, the same forming the positive pole. The cross is made
of aluminum. There was a novel action, however, discovered
in addition to the mere casting of a shadow. The glass which
had become phosphorescent except within the shadow, became
after a while, less phosphorescent. Its property to phosphoresce
became less as proved by removing the cross, which was
arranged to fall down upon tipping the bulb. Immediately, the
part which was within the shadow became brighter than the
rest of the glass, thereby reversing the appearances, by making
a luminous picture of the cross upon only partially phosphorescent
glass. A remarkable feature is that the glass never recovered
its first exhibited power of phosphorescence, neither did
this power entirely become nothing, however many times the
tube was employed. Was the deposit of metal from the cathode
the cause?</p>
<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span><a id='E58a'></a>58<i>a</i>. <span class='sc'>Mechanical Motion Produced by Radiations from the
Negative Pole.</span> It occured to Crookes that the radiations from
the cathode might perhaps cause a wheel to turn around. He
therefore had a minute wheel made by Mr. Gimingham, like an
undershot water wheel, and its axle rested on two rails of glass,
so that it might roll along from one end of the tube to the other.
The vanes were exactly opposite to the plane surface of the
cathode. The molecular stream or radiations, or whatever they
may be, possibly vibrations, from the cathode, were so powerful
mechanically that the wheel was caused to run up hill, the tube
being inclined very slightly. On the principle that action and
reaction are equal, he built another device in which the negative
electrode was movable, and he observed that when the current
was on, the negative electrode moved slightly. Upon these
principles he built the well-known Crookes radiometer in which
the vanes rotated by reaction of the radiations. The vanes in
this form of radiometer were made of aluminum, and a cup of
hard steel served as the bearing, Fig. 12, p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>. One side of
each disk was coated with a thin scale of mica. The aluminum
disks formed the cathode, while the anode was located at the
top. The operation consisted in connecting the terminals as
stated, so that the vanes were the negative poles and it was
observed that the little wheel rotated. The vacuum was not as
high as that for obtaining phosphorescence. With a low vacuum,
an envelope of violet light existed near the surface of the aluminum
vanes. Effects were carefully studied by maintaining
connection with the pump. At the pressure of .5 mm. there
was a dark cylinder opposite the aluminum extending to the
glass, and this was the pressure at which the vanes began to
rotate. The dark spaces opposite each vane became larger and
larger in width, until they appeared to be opposed or resisted by
the inner surface of the glass, and then the rotation became
very rapid. He modified this experiment by having vanes entirely
of mica, and by having the cathode disconnected electrically
from the vanes, Fig. 13, p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>. A coil of metal near the
vanes served as the cathode. The anode was at a distance in
the top of the tube as in Fig. 12, p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>. During the electrical
discharge, the wheels rotated by radiations from the coil which
formed the cathode. He made the discovery that when this
coil was heated red hot conveniently by a current from a primary
battery, the vanes also rotated, showing that there is probably
some relation between the radiations from the cathode
and heat rays. The fact remains however, that both kinds of
rays produced rotation, directly or indirectly.</p>
<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span><a id='E59'></a>59. <span class='sc'>Action of Magnet Upon Cathode Rays.</span>—He had two
tubes, one of which is shown in Fig. 14 and the other in Fig. 15,
on page <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>. In the former, the vacuum was so low that a violet
stream of light existed between the electrodes. In the other,
the rays were invisible, but were converted into luminosity by
projection at an exceedingly slight angle, upon a phosphorescent
screen arranged along the length of the tube and inside
thereof. Inasmuch as the whole surface of the cathode in the
latter case radiated parallel and invisible rays, he cut off some
of them by a mica screen having a hole in the centre and located
near the negative pole, so that only a pencil of invisible
rays could go through the mica screen and act upon the phosphorescent
screen. In both cases, there was visible a
straight pencil of light. Now notice the effect which took
place upon locating a magnet as indicated in the figures. With
the low vacuum, the pencil was bent out of its course but returned
again to the line of its original path. <a href='#E28'>§ 28</a>. With the
high vacuum, the rays were bent but did not return to their original
direction nor parallel thereto. In the former case, the
magnet acted as upon a very delicate flexible conductor, while
in the latter, it acted, as Crookes said, like the earth upon projectiles.
He modified the latter experiment in order to determine
if the similarity between this phenomenon and gravitation
existed in other respects. He anticipated that if the molecular
resistance to the rays were increased they would be bent more
out of their course like a horizontally projected bullet. He
therefore heated the caustic potash sticks slightly, and in view
of the liberation of molecules of water within the vacuum tube,
the rays, he thought, would be resisted; and such was the case
to all appearances, for then the pencil of light was bent out of
its course to a greater extent, although the magnetic power remained
the same as well as the <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> producing the electric
discharge. He therefore established, apparently, the principle
that the magnetic actions upon cathode rays vary somewhat in
their nature according to the degree of vacuum. In either case,
it may be stated incidentally, that when the magnet was moved
to and fro, the pencils of light waved back and forth.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the modified form of construction over that shown in Fig.
15, p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>, he caused a wheel to rotate that was located in the high
vacuum. The vanes of the wheel were so located that the faces
of the same were perpendicular to the direction of the pencil of
the rays radiating from the cathode. When the magnet deflected
the rays, the wheel ceased rotation.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E60'></a>60. <span class='sc'>Mutual Repulsion of Cathode Rays.</span>—If the little mica
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>screen, as shown in Fig. 16, p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a> has two holes, and if there are
two cathodes instead of one, there will also be two pencils of
light. He performed an experiment involving the latter modification,
and the result was something that could not have been
predicted. The two pencils, as displayed by the long fluorescent
screen, repelled each other like molecules similarly electrified.
The white pencils, it will be noticed, were repelled from
each other and showed their condition when both of the negative
poles were in circuit. The black pencils show the location
of both of the pencils when only one pole is in circuit at a time,
the direction being perpendicular to the plane of the cathode
disc (<a href='#E57'>§ 57</a>) at end.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E61'></a>61. <span class='sc'>Heating and Lighting Power of Cathode Rays. Heat
of Phosphorescent Spot.</span>—By making the cathode concave as
in Fig. 10, p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>, and so locating it that the focus of the cathode
rays falls upon some substance, the latter becomes very hot. In
this way Crookes melted wax on the outside of the bulb at the
phosphorescent spot. Further than this, the heat was so great
that it cracked the glass without at first injuring the vacuum;
next the glass at this point softened, and the air, by its pressure,
rushed into the bulb, forcing a hole through the soft part. He
performed an experiment also which illustrated the intensity of
the heat when the rays were brought to a focus. He used an
unusually large electrode like a concave mirror, and in the focus,
which was near the centre of the bulb, he supported a small
piece of iridio-platinum. At first, with a moderately low <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span>,
the metal was made white hot. When a magnet was caused to
approach, the rays were drawn to one side, <a href='#E59'>§ 59</a>, and the little
piece of metal cooled. He then put in all the coils of an inductorium,
and allowed the metal not only to become white hot, but
to become so heated that it melted. How little did Prof. Crookes
know about the most important phenomena associated with his
experiment. Although he was so exceedingly enthusiastic and
ingenious in planning his experiments, and in reasoning, yet it
seems almost mysterious that he should have been subjected to
what have become known as X-rays, which passed into his body,
and would have photographed portions of his skeleton, and
which would have performed outside of the tube many of the
acts that were noticed within. Seventeen years elapsed between
the time of Crookes on the one hand, and Lenard and Roentgen’s
discoveries on the other. Dr. Lodge, F.R.S., (<i>The Elect.</i>, Lon.,
Jan. 31, ’96, p. 438,) and Lenard, in his first paper, attributed to
Hittorf the discovery of the mere existence of cathode rays, but
credited to Crookes the full establishment of their properties,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>deduction of their principles and formulation of an ingenious
theory.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E61a'></a>61<i>a</i> As an appropriate conclusion to Crookes’ work, I cannot
do better than to let Lord Kelvin repeat what he said in his
Pres. Addr., <i>Ro. So.</i>, Nov. ’93, see also <i>The Elect.</i>, Lon. Feb. 14,
’96, p. 522, showing that a small portion of the credit is due not
only to Hittorf, <a href='#E53'>§ 53</a>, but to Varley. “His short paper of 1871,
which, strange to say has lain almost or quite unperceived in the
<i>Proceedings</i> during the 22 years since its publication, contains an
important first instalment of discovery in a new field, the molecular
torrent <a href='#E53'>§ 53</a>, at centre, from the ‘negative pole,’ the control
of its course by a magnet, <a href='#E59'>§ 59</a>, its pressure against either end
of a pivoted vane of mica, <a href='#E59'>§ 59</a>, at end, and the shadow produced
by its interception by a mica screen, <a href='#E58'>§ 58</a>. Quite independently
of Varley, and not knowing what he had done, Crookes (<i>Roy.
Inst. Proc.</i>, April 4, ’79, vol. LX, p. 138. <i>Ro. So. Trans.</i>, ’74, “On
attractions and repulsions resulting from radiation” Part II, ’76,
parts III and IV, ’76, part V, ’78, part VI, ’79) was led to the
same primary discovery, not by accident and not merely by experimental
skill and acuteness of observation.” * * * * “He
brought all his work more and more into touch with the kinetic
theory of gases; so much so, that when he discovered the molecular
torrent he immediately gave it its true explanation—molecules
of residual air, or gas or vapor projected at great velocities
(probably, I believe not greater in any case than 2 or 3 kilometers
per second, <a href='#E61b2'>§ 61<i>b</i></a>), by electric repulsion from the negative
electrode. This explanation has been repeatedly and strenuously
attacked by many other able investigators, but Crookes has
defended (Presidential address to the <i>Inst. Elect. Eng.</i>, 1891.) it,
and thoroughly established it by what I believe is irrefragable
evidence of experiment. Skillful investigations perseveringly
continued brought out more and more wonderful and valuable
results; the non-importance of the position of the positive electrode,
<a href='#E57'>§ 57</a>, near end, the projection of the torrent perpendicularly
from the surface of the negative electrode, <a href='#E57'>§ 57</a>, at end; its
convergence into a focus and divergence thenceforward when
the surface is slightly concave, <a href='#E47'>§ 47</a>, near beginning; the slight
but perceptible repulsion, <a href='#E60'>§ 60</a>, between two parallel torrents
due, according to Crookes, to negative electrifications of their
constituent molecules; the change of the direction of the molecular
torrent by a neighboring magnet, <a href='#E59'>§ 59</a>. the tremendous
heating effect of the torrent from a concave electrode when glass,
metal or any ponderable substance is placed in the focus, <a href='#E61'>§ 61</a>.

<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>paint by a molecular torrent skirting along it, Fig. 15, p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>; the

and thereby caused to rapidly evaporate, <a href='#E40'>§ 40</a> and <a href='#E139'>139<i>a</i></a>.
This last named result is almost more surprising than the phosphorescent
glow excited by molecular impacts on bodies not
rendered perceptibly phosphorescent by light, <a href='#E55'>§ 55</a>, at centre.
Both phenomena will usually be found very telling in respect to
the molecular constitution of matter and origination of thermal
radiation, whether visible as light or not. In the whole train of
Crookes investigations on the radiometer, the viscosity of gases
at high exhaustion, and the electro-phenomena of high vacuums,
ether seems to have nothing to do except the humble function
of showing to our eye something of what the molecules and
atoms are doing. The same confession of ignorance must be
made with reference to the subject dealt with in the important
researches of Schuster and J. J. Thomson on the passage of
electricity through gases. Even in Thomson’s beautiful experiments,
showing currents produced by circuital electro-magnetic
induction in complete poleless circuits, the presence of molecules
of residual gas or vapor seems to be <i>the essential</i>. It seems
certainly true that without the molecules, electricity has no
meaning. But in obedience to logic, I must withdraw one expression
I have used. We must not imagine the “presence
of molecules is <i>the</i> essential.” It is certainly <i>an</i> essential. Ether
is certainly also <i>an</i> essential, and certainly has more to do than
merely to telegraph to our eyes to tell us what the molecules
and atoms are about. If the first step towards understanding
the relations between ether and ponderable matter is to be made
it seems to me that the most hopeful foundation for it is knowledge
derived from experiment on electricity in high vacuum;
and if, as I believe is true there is good reason for hoping to see
this step made, we owe a debt of gratitude to the able and persevering
workers of the last 40 years who have given us the
knowledge we have; and we may hope for more and more from
some of themselves and from others encouraged by the fruitfulness
of their labors to persevere in the work.”</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span><i>The Elect.</i>, Lon., Oct. 5, ’94, p. 762; <i>Phil. Mag.</i>, ’94.—The object
of the experiment of J. J. Thomson was to determine whether
the velocity approached that of light or that of molecules. The
apparatus he employed involved the rotating mirror, which was
fully described in <i>Proc. Royal So.</i>, ’90, slightly modified. The
rays were caused to produce phosphorescence, while the mirror
was so adjusted that when at rest, the two images on the phosphorescent
strips appeared in the same rectilinear line. Many
other elements comprised the apparatus. All the steps were
performed carefully and according to the best methods, but the
results are those which in this experiment are of particular interest,
for by knowing the velocity of the rays, their nature is
better appreciated and that of the X-rays can be better deduced.
The velocity bore a close relation to that of the mean square of
the molecules of gases at temperatures zero ° C. or in the case of
hydrogen, 1.8 × 10<sup>5</sup> cm. per second. As compared with such
a velocity, that of the cathode rays was found to be in the neighborhood
of 100 times as great, and this agrees very nearly with
the velocity of a negatively electrified atom of hydrogen acquired
under the influence of the potential fall, which occurred
at the cathode. In further evidence of the verity of this statement,
he made a rough calculation upon the curve or displacement
produced by a magnet upon the rays. <a href='#E59'>§ 59</a>. He stated:
“The action of a magnetic force in deflecting the rays shows,
assuming that the deflection is due to the action of a magnet on
a moving electrified body, that the velocity of the atom must be
at least of the order we have found.”</p>

Negative Electricity. Corresponding Positive Charges
Propagated in the Reverse Direction and Precipitated
upon the Cathode.</span> <i>Comptes Rendus</i>, CXXI., No. 20, p. 1130;
<i>The Elect.</i>, Lon., Feb. 14, ’96, p. 523.—Jean Perrin’s object was
to discover whether or not internal “Cathode rays were charged
with negative electricity.” That they were had often been assumed
by others, namely, Prof. J. J. Thomson, who considered
cathode rays as due to negatively charged matter moving at
high speed. <a href='#E61b1'>§ 61<i>b</i></a>. Again, Prof. Crookes, principally, and
others, showed that they were possessed of mechanical properties
and that they were deflected by a magnet. <a href='#E59'>§ 59</a>. Perrin
called attention to the above investigations and also alluded to
the theoretical considerations of Goldstein, Hertz and Lenard,
who favored the analogy of cathode rays to light—whose phenomena
are well answered by the accepted theory concerning assumed
etherial vibrations, which, in both cases, have rectilinear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>propagation, <a href='#E57'>§ 57</a>, excite phosphorescence, <a href='#E54'>§ 54</a> and <a href='#E55'>55</a>, and produce
chemical action upon photographic plates. Great ingenuity
was displayed, as might be expected, in the manner in which
Jean Perrin proved the proposition named in the title of this
section, at the Laboratory of the École Normale and also in M.
Pallet’s Laboratory. First, therefore, let the elements of the
discharge tube be thoroughly understood. As usual, the disk <span class='fss'>N</span>
is the cathode, referring to accompanying Fig. <a href='#i048'>1</a>. <span class='fss'>A</span>,
<span class='fss'>B</span>, <span class='fss'>C</span>, <span class='fss'>D</span>, is a
metal cylinder having a small opening at the right hand end
toward the cathode. Concentrically, is a similar cylinder, acting
as an electrical screen and having a like opening similarly
located as indicated. It corresponds to and plays the part of
the Faraday cylinder, being connected to earth. The principle
involved in this apparatus was based upon the laws of influence,
which permitted him to ascertain the introduction of electric
charges within a conducting envelope, and to measure such
charges. During the discharge, the cathode rays were propagated
from the cathode to and within the cylinder <span class='fss'>A</span>, <span class='fss'>B</span>,
<span class='fss'>C</span>, <span class='fss'>D</span>, which immediately and invariably became charged with
negative electricity. To prove that the charge was due to
the cathode rays, he deflected them away from the opening in
the protecting cylinder <span class='fss'>E</span>, <span class='fss'>F</span>, <span class='fss'>G</span>, <span class='fss'>H</span>. The cylinder was not under
these circumstances charged, the rays being outside. He
went further and made some quantitative analysis in a rough
way to begin with. He related: “I may give an idea of the
amount of the charges obtained when I state that with one of
my tubes, at a pressure of .001 m. of mercury, and for a single
interruption of the primary coil, the cylinder <span class='fss'>A</span>, <span class='fss'>B</span>, <span class='fss'>C</span>, <span class='fss'>D</span>, received
sufficient electricity to bring a capacity of 600 <span class='fss'>C. G. S.</span> units to a
potential of 300 volts.” Upon the principle of the conservation
of energy, he was induced, he said, to search for corresponding
positive charges. “I believe I have found them in the very
region where the cathode rays are generated, and that they
travel in the reverse direction and precipitate themselves on to
the cathode.” He verified this corollary by means of a modified
feature of the apparatus shown in Fig. <a href='#i049'>2</a>. The construction was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>the same except that there was a diaphragm having a perforation
β´ within the protecting cylinder and opposite the smaller
cylinder exactly as indicated, so that the positive electricity
which had entered through β could only act on the cylinder <span class='fss'>A</span>, <span class='fss'>B</span>,
<span class='fss'>C</span>, <span class='fss'>D</span>, by traversing also the hole β´.
“When <span class='fss'>N</span> was the cathode,
the rays emitted traversed the two apertures at β and β´ without
any difficulty, and caused the gold leaves of the electroscope to
diverge widely. But when the protecting cylinder was the cathode,
the positive flux, which, as was shown by a previous experiment,
enters by the aperture β, did not succeed in separating
the gold leaves, except at very low pressures. If we substitute
an electrometer for the electroscope we shall see that the action
of the positive flux is real, but that it is very small and increases
as the pressure decreases.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He inferred that: “These results, taken as a whole, do not
appear to be easily reconcilable with the theory that the cathode
rays are ultra-violet light. On the contrary, they support the
theory that attributes these rays to radiant matter, <a href='#E54'>§ 54</a>, near
centre, a theory, which may at present, it seems to me, be enunciated
as follows: In the vicinity of the cathode the electric field
is sufficiently strong to tear asunder into <i>ions</i> some of the molecules
of the residual gas. The negative ions start off toward
the region where the potential increases, acquire a considerable
velocity, and form cathode rays; their electric charge, and consequently
their mass (at the rate of one gramme equivalent per
100,000 coulombs) is easily measured. The positive ions move
in the reverse direction; they form a diffused tuft, susceptible
to magnetism, but are not a regular radiation.”</p>

of a vacuum bulb, during and immediately after
the discharge. The details are as follows: The spectrum of
the after-glow, <a href='#E54'>§ 54</a>, at end and 22, was found to be continuous.
In this connection, see a plate showing different kinds of spectra,
for example, <i>Ganot’s Physics</i>, frontispiece. The spectrum shortened
from both directions to a band between the wave lengths
of 555 and 495µµ. The spectrum then continued to grow shorter
and shorter until it disappeared at the line E, which is the position
of the greatest luminosity of the solar spectrum. For experiments
on spectrum, see Fraunhofer in <i>Gilbert’s Ann.</i>, LVI.
During the discharge, the spectroscope showed a line spectrum
corresponding very closely to those of carbonic acid gas and
nitrogen. Some authorities had suggested that perhaps the
after phosphorescence and the beginning of the incandescence
of a solid body, were the same kind of light, but this experiment
shows that such is not the case, unless some relation exists
on the ground that the two phenomena are exactly opposite to
each other, and it confirms similar results obtained by Morrin
and Riess. The result indicates that the nature of the phenomenon
is not identical in all respects with light produced at a high
temperature.</p>

tube divided into two halves which fitted together by an
air-tight ground joint. In one-half were the anode and the
cathode; in the other half was the holder containing the sensitive
paper or films. The holder was exposed to the direct action of
the cathode rays and was closed by a cover of cardboard or sheet
aluminum. The objects to be photographed were placed
between the cover and the sensitive film or paper. The tube was
connected to a Sprengel pump which maintained its vacuum
during the experiments. In this way, twelve photographs were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>taken from which it appeared that cathode rays, like X-rays,
penetrate cardboard and aluminum, but are stopped by copper
(1.26 mm.) and platinum (0.32 mm.). Poincaré, in a note in the
same publications as the foregoing, criticised the results of the
experiments of De Metz, claiming they did not prove irrefutably
that cathode rays possessed the essential properties of X-rays,
for the cathode rays in impinging on the cover of the holder
would generate X-rays, <a href='#E91'>§ 91</a>, which would give the results obtained.
Poincaré did not deny the fact.</p>

Through Thin Metal Plates Within the Discharge Tube. Diffusion.</span>
<i>Wied. Ann.</i>, N. F. 45; 28, 1892. Contributed by request,
by Mr. N. D. C. Hodges of the <i>Hodges Scientific News
Agency</i>, N.Y. Found in records at Astor Library.—A piece of
uranium glass was covered partly on one side (which he calls the
front side) with gold-leaf, and on the gold leaf were attached
several pieces of mica. This front side was then exposed to
cathode rays. So long as the exhaustion had not proceeded far,
and the cathode rays filled the whole tube with a blue cone of
light, only the portion of the uranium glass outside the gold-leaf
screen showed any phosphorescence. But as soon as the exhaustion
had progressed far enough, and the light began to disappear,
the genuine cathode rays struck the covered glass, and the phosphorescence
manifested itself behind the gold-leaf. When the
cathode rays were fully developed, the gold-leaf hardly had any
effect, while the mica cast deep black shadows. The same experiment
was tried with silver-leaf, aluminum and alloys of tin,
zinc and copper. Aluminum showed the best results; sheets
which allowed no light to pass, allowing the cathode rays free
passage. The rays after their passage through the metal screens
did not continue their straight course, but seemed to be diffused
much as light is diffused by passing through a cloudy medium.
In this connection reference is made to the work of Goldstein,
who had noticed also the reflection of “electric” rays. <i>Wied.

Discharge Tube.</span> <i>Wied. Ann.</i>, Jan., ’94, Vol. LVI., p. 225; <i>The
Elect.</i>, Lon., Mar. 23 and 30, ’94, Apr. 6, ’94; and <i>Elect. Rev.</i>,
Lon., Jan. 24, ’96, p. 99.—Of more importance in connection
with X-rays is the consideration of Lenard’s experiments than
any others. The reader must bear in mind that his exhaustive
investigations resulted from his discovery (founded upon a hint
from Hertz) that the cathode rays might be transmitted to the
outside of the generating discharge tube. His interest, therefore,
in the discovery was so great that his researches extended
to the minutest details. Passing from these introductory remarks,
the characteristics of the tube that he employed will be
explained first. Reference may now be made to the accompanying
Fig. <a href='#i052'><span class='fss'>A</span></a>. He employed several different kinds of tubes,
but finally settled upon one of which the essential elements are
shown in the said figures. It was permanently connected to the
pump, <a href='#E53'>§ 53</a>, so that the pressure within could be varied. Opposite
the cathode, which consisted of a thin disk of aluminum, the
end of the tube was provided with a thick metal cap, having a
perforation, which in turn was closed by a thin aluminum sheet
secured by marine glue in an air-tight manner, and called a
window. The anode was a heavy brass cylinder, shown in section,
within the discharge tube and surrounding the leading-in
wire of the cathode. The anode and the aluminum window
were connected to each other, electrically, and to earth, as well
as two a secondary terminal of an induction coil, whose electrodes
were in shunt to those of the discharge tube, in order that
the operator might adjust the sparking distance which rapidly
increased with the exhaustion. The induction coil had a mercury
interrupter.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E65bottom'></a>65. <span class='sc'>Properties of Cathode Rays in Open Air.</span>—In all directions
around the window upon the outside and in the open
air, a faint bluish glow (<a href='#E11'>§ 11</a> and <a href='#E140'>140</a>) extended and vanished at a
distance of 5 cm., as indicated by dotted lines in Fig. <a href='#i052'><span class='fss'>B</span></a> at beginning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>of this chapter. The degree of luminosity may be
judged by saying that it was not sufficient to admit of investigation
by the ordinary pocket spectroscope. A new window
was void of luminosity; but with use, bluish gray and green and
yellow spots occurred thereon.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E66'></a>66. <span class='sc'>Phosphorescence by Cathode Rays.</span>—Substances which
generally phosphoresced by light and cathode rays in the generating
bulb, <a href='#E55'>§ 55</a>, also phosphoresced under the influence of the
rays in open air, excepting eosin, gelatin, both phosphorescent
in light, were not so in cathode rays; so also with solutions of
fluorescein, magdala red, sulphate of quinine and chlorophyll.
Phosphorescence was less if the rays first passed through a tube
of glass or tinfoil lengthwise. The phosphorescent light of the
phosphides of the alkaline group, uranium glass, calcspar and
some other substances, was so great that the luminosity of the
air was invisible by contrast. The maximum distance at which
phosphorescense was discernable in open air was about 8 cm.
The best phosphorescent screen consisted of paper saturated
with pentadecylparatatolylketone. In order to prepare it, he
laid a sheet of paper upon glass and applied the fused chemical
with a brush. As to the color of the phosphorescence and fluorescence
of different substances, and as to the degree of luminosity
outside of the vacuum tube, they were about the same as
reported by Crookes when located within the discharge tube.
§55. Baric and potassic and other double cyanides of platinum,
common flint, glass, chalk and asaron all exhibited the same
property as when exposed to ultra-violet light, that is, fluoresced
or phosphoresced. Sulphide of quinine in the <i>solid</i> state fluoresced,
but not in <i>solution</i>. Petroleum spread on a piece of
wood fluoresced, and also fluorescent-hydrocarbons generally.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E66a'></a>66<i>a</i>. The cathode rays were not easily transmitted by tinfoil
or glass, because the degree of phosphorescence on the screen
was greatly reduced by interposing such sheets. The phosphorescense
ceased also by deflecting internal cathode rays from
the window by a magnet. For full treatment of the phenomena
of phosphorescence, see Stokes’ experiments, described in <i>Phil.
Trans.</i>, 1852, Art. “Change of Refrangibility of Light.” In
brief, Stokes’ theory assumes that such substances have the
power of reducing the refrangibility. Example: Ultra-violet
light, highly refractive, is changed to yellowish green, less refrangible,
by reflection from uranium glass.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E67'></a>67. <span class='sc'>The Aluminum Window, a Diffuser of Cathode Rays.</span>
<a href='#E63b'>§ 63<i>b</i></a>. The conclusion arrived at by mounting the phosphorescent
screen in different positions and at different angles as well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>as by observance of the gaseous luminosity, was that the aluminum
window scattered the rectilinear parallel cathode rays in
all directions, <a href='#E57'>§ 57</a>.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E68'></a>68. <span class='sc'>Transmission of External Cathode Rays Through
Metals.</span>—The phosphorescence was not diminished apparently
by an intervening gold-leaf or silver or aluminum foil, while it
was extinguished by quartz .5 mm. thick which also cut off the
atmospheric glow beyond itself. The leaves and foil did not so
act. The difference of thickness should be borne in mind, as
metal, as thick as the quartz did not transmit. As to other substances,
tissue paper cast a slight shadow, which was darker with
an additional sheet; but the shadow was independent of color
and blackness, <a href='#E154'>§ 154</a>. Ordinary writing paper was roughly,
proportionally opaque, while the shadow was black with cardboard
.3 mm. thick. Glass films as made by blowing glass, cast
faint shadows when .01 mm. thick. He proved that there was
little difference as to the transmitting power of conductors and
dielectrics when thin. Mica and collodion sheets .01 mm. thick
cast scarcely any shadow. The reader may bear in mind the
striking differences between these properties of cathode rays,
and X-rays, <a href='#E135'>§ 135</a>, it being assumed always that the generating
devices are the same; for example, water permitted the cathode
rays (were these simply feeble X-rays?) to be transmitted
only when in very thin layers. Even soap water films which
were only .0012 mm. thick cast shadows, although very faintly.
The shadows of drops of water were black, while water several
feet thick has been traversed by X-rays from a small set of
apparatus. By careful measurements he found that the law of
transmission must be different from that of light, for in the latter,
many substances are opaque although exceedingly thin,
while with cathode rays, the same will traverse all films. Goldstein
and Crookes reported that thin mica, glass and collodion
films made very dark shadows, <a href='#E58'>§ 58</a>, within the discharge tube,
whereas Lenard found that outside of the vacuum tube, in open
air, the transparency was greater than according to the earlier
experimenters, but he acknowledged that Crookes and Goldstein
were inconvenienced and limited in the number of observations
because it is so difficult to carry on such experiments within an
hermetically sealed tube. Again, he acknowledged that perhaps
the cathode rays of those experimenters were of a different kind.
The construction shown in the above figures was modified by
using a very thin glass window instead of aluminum, and the
results were the same allowing for the different opacity, to ordinary
light, of aluminum and glass.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>The cathode rays acted upon the sense of smell and taste as
the nose and mouth could detect ozone, <a href='#E84'>§ 84</a>, at end.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E69'></a>69. <span class='sc'>Propagation. Turbidity of Air.</span> Upon studying the
shadows on the phosphorescent screen, it was noticed that the
rays were bent around the edges of the object. Again, when
the object had a slit, diffusion could be noticed by the shape (as
in Crookes Ex., Fig. 15, p. <a href='#Page_17'>17</a>,) of the luminous portion of the
phosphorescent screen. In Fig. <a href='#i052'>B</a>, at beginning of this chapter,
the spatter work represents the shape of the luminous portion,
the darker part representing the most luminous surface of the
screen, the latter being held at right angles to the thick plate,
having the slit and opposite the aluminum window. By varying
these experiments, especially by changing the angle of the screen
he found that not the all rays were diffused, but as in the passage
of light through milk, some were transmitted in rectilinear
lines.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E70'></a>70. <span class='sc'>Photographic Action.</span>—He performed with sensitive
silver compound papers, an experiment somewhat similar to
those with phosphorescent bodies and also others. Behind a
rather thick opaque plate the chemical film was not acted upon,
but the rate of blackening near the aluminum window without
obstruction of intermediate bodies was about the same as that
with befogged sunlight. The former, moreover, was acted
upon at a much greater distance than that at which phosphorescence
was exhibited and beyond the atmospheric luminosity.
By means of shadow pictures or sciagraphs, he compared the
shadows produced by the external cathode rays with those which
would have been obtained by light. Referring to Fig. <a href='#i052'>C</a>, beginning
of this chapter, the sensitive plate was half covered with
a plate of quartz, <span class='fss'>Q</span>, and half with a plate of aluminum, <span class='fss'>A</span>´ overlapping
the quartz. With light, the shadows would have appeared
as in said figure, that is, one-half black as produced by
aluminum, a quarter rather light as produced by quartz, and the
other quarter bright, or a similar arrangement, according to
whether the negative or the positive photograph is considered;
but with the cathode rays, the appearance of the developed
plate was as in Fig. <a href='#i052'>D</a>., beginning of this chapter. The quartz
cast the black shadow, while the aluminum, the lighter one.
Furthermore, the luminosity of the air produced a variable light
on the other quarters. A similar appearance was produced by
casting shadows of such plates upon the phosphorescent screen;
but, of course, the picture was not a permanent one. The photographic
plate served to accumulate the power, for the cardboard
which cast a faint shadow upon the phosphorescent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>screen, showed a black shadow upon the photographic paper by
sufficiently long exposure. At the same time, strips of thin
metal were placed side by side between the chemical paper and
the cardboard, and they showed different degrees of shading.
The cardboard was quite thick, being .3 mm. Prof. Slaby (see
<i>Elect. Rev.</i>, Lon., Feb. 7, ’96), <i>after</i> Röntgen’s discovery, produced
sciagraphs of the bones of the hand at the window of the
Lenard tube. Lenard doubted whether the cathode rays produced
direct chemical action. Iodine paper became bluish, but
he could not obtain other chemical effects usually produced by
light, and other agencies, for example, oxygen and hydrogen
mixed together in the proportion to form water, and which were
in their nascent state, and which were located in a soap-bubble,
did not explode or ignite. No effect was produced upon carbon
bi-sulphide nor hydrogen-sulphide, although the exposure was
very long. Ammonia was not formed when the rays acted
upon a mixture of three parts hydrogen and one part nitrogen,
as to volume. He thought that he noticed a small expansion
of air, hydrogen and carbonic acid separately located in a vessel
having a capillary tube and water to indicate the expansion.
He attributed the slight expansion to an indirect action, although
very slight, caused by heat produced by the cathode
rays, <a href='#E27'>§ 27</a>, and yet neither the thermopile nor the thermometer
showed any calorific effects although the thermopile responded
to the flame of a candle 50 cm. distant.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E71'></a>71. <span class='sc'>Cathode Rays and Electric Forces Distinguished.</span> The
earth connection heretofore mentioned with the aluminum window
was for the purpose of dispensing with sparking, but even
then the approach of another conductor connected to earth
would cause some sparking. Sparks could be drawn when the
cathode rays were deflected from the aluminum window by a
magnet. Fig. <a href='#i052'>E</a>, at beginning of chapter. He argued that the
rays and the electric forces of the spark are non-identical. He
was not satisfied with this as an absolute proof, and he instituted
others. He enclosed the whole generator in a large metal box.
In the observation space, that is, around and near the window,
he located another box, having an aluminum front facing the
window. See Fig. <a href='#i052'>E</a>, at beginning of chapter. It was within
this second box that he took the sciagraph shown in Fig. <a href='#i052'>D</a>, at
beginning of chapter. It is important to notice that sparks could
not be drawn at points within the said second box, shown at the
left, even by a metallic point shown projecting thereinto. No
spark occurred whatever, not even from the aluminum front.
Sparking occurred when the pointed wire was extended to a considerable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>distance outside of the back of the small box, but it
was remarked that the electric force did not enter through the
front wall but was introduced “from behind into the box, by the
insulation of the wire.” No one can, therefore, enter the objection
that the cathode rays experimented with, were generated
from the aluminum window as a cathode. They came from the
cathode referred to entirely within the vacuum tube. Prof. J. J.
Thomson, F. R. S., had at an early date conjectured that cathode
rays did not pass through thin films of metal, but that these
films acted as intermediate cathodes themselves. See his book
on “<i>Recent Researches</i>,” p. 26, also <i>The Elect.</i>, Lon. March 23, ’94,
p. 573, in an article by Prof. Fitzgerald, who names that citation.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E72'></a>72. <span class='sc'>Cathode Rays Propagated, but not Generated in a
High Vacuum.</span>—The proposition was proved by having two
tubes, one called the generating tube and one the observation
tube, the former being like that shown in Fig. <a href='#i052'>A</a>, at beginning
of chapter, which is partly repeated in Fig. <a href='#i052'>F</a>, at beginning of
chapter, combined with the observation tube, which contains the
two electrodes for casual use; but the one on the right is a disk
extending nearly throughout the cross sectional area, and having
a small central opening. Although both tubes were connected
to the air pump, yet, by means of stop-cocks, the vacuum
in one tube could be maintained at a maximum degree for hours,
while the other was at a minimum. The first experiment was
performed with a vacuum, about as high as that employed in
Crookes’ phosphorescent experiments, <a href='#E53'>§ 53</a>. There was a patch
of green light, <a href='#E57'>§ 57</a>, at the extreme left end of the observation
tube and the glass was green at the right, <a href='#E54'>§ 54</a>, and a little to
the left of the perforated disk electrode <i>a</i>. The other electrode
of this tube was located at the upper left and lettered <i>k</i>.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E72a'></a>72<i>a</i>. The magnet deflected the rays <i>in the observing tube</i> as indicated
by the partial extinction of the phosphorescent patch.
He noticed that with the rarefied atmosphere the amount of
turbidity was enormously reduced, or in other words, that the rays
were propagated more nearly in rectilinear lines. All the experiments
on the cathode rays, in this observing tube, were of
about the same nature as those which could be produced in
the discharge tube.</p>

</div>
<p class='c013'><a id='E72b'></a>72<i>b</i>. The principal experiment consisted in exhausting the
observing tube to such a degree that cathode rays could not be
generated therein. The vacuum was so perfect that when used
as a discharge tube all phosphorescence gradually died away
until it disappeared, and no current passed (<a href='#E25'>§ 25</a>) except on the
outside surface of the glass. The coil was so large, electrically,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>that the length of the spark between spheres was 15 cm. Upon
charging the right hand tube and generating cathode rays, it
was determined by means of magnetic deflection, phosphorescence
and other effects, that the cathode rays traversed the
highest possible vacuum (<a href='#E19'>§ 19</a>, near end, where energy must
have passed through the high vacuum to produce luminosity in
the inner bulb). The external and internal rays were certainly
different forms of energy. Inasmuch as he noticed that rarefied
air was less turbid and less absorptive than air at ordinary
pressures, it occurred to him to make a very long tube, namely,
1 m, or a little over 3 feet. He employed very severe steps for
obtaining an exceedingly high vacuum, the operation occupying
several days. The pump used was a Toepler-Hagen, while a
Geissler pump was employed separately for the discharge tube.
The pencil of cathode rays traversed the whole length of the
long tube. See a portion of the apparatus in Fig. <a href='#i052'>G</a>, at beginning
of this chapter. One disk was of metal and perforated with
a pin hole and the other was a phosphorescent screen, so that
when the cathode pencil passed through the hole in the plate a
patch was seen upon the phosphorescent screen. The phosphorescent
spot was always, no matter what the relative distances of
the disks were from each other, and from the end of the tube,
substantially the same as it would have been by calculation assuming
that there was no turbidity effect. The patches, in each
instance, were a little smaller in diameter than the calculated
ones. For example with one measurement, at certain distances,
the actual diameter of the patch was 2.5 mm., while the calculated
diameter was 2.9 mm. In his experiments with light under
the same conditions, the luminous spots were also a little
smaller than the calculated or geometrical. The disks had iron
shoes and were moved to different positions by a magnet. He
concluded, therefore, that in what may be called a perfect vacuum,
light and cathode rays have a common medium of propagation,
namely, the assumed ether. Prof. Fitzgerald, in <i>The
Elect.</i>, Lon. Mar. 23, ’94, does not agree broadly with him in this;
neither does he contradict him. He argues rather on the point
that the cathode rays and light rays are not identical, but Lenard
does not affirm this, because the magnet will attract the
former and not the other. Prof. Fitzgerald admits this and calls
to mind that even in a vacuum, as obtained by Lenard, there
were still ten thousand million molecules per cu. mm. and therefore
he thinks it is better to look to matter rather than ether as
the medium of propagation of cathode rays. <a href='#E61b1'>§ 61<i>b</i></a>. On the
other hand, Lenard agrees with certain other predecessors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>Wiedemann, Hertz and Goldstein, in favor of cathode rays being
etheric phenomena. See <i>Wied. Ann.</i>, IX., p. 159, ’80; X., p. 251,
’80, XII., p. 264, ’81; XIX., p. 816, ’83; XX., p. 781, ’83. The
vacuum with which Lenard operated, was .00002 mm. pressure,
obtained by cooling down the mercury to minus 21° C. This
vacuum was so high that all attempts to prove the presence of
matter failed. Neither did the exceedingly high vacuum deaden
the cathode rays. On the other hand, as noted, they were assisted
rather than hindered. <a href='#E135'>§ 135</a>.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E73'></a>73. <span class='sc'>Cathode Rays. Phenomena in Different Gases.</span>—The
apparatus consisted of an observing tube having a tubular gas
inlet and outlet both in one end and arranged in line with the
cathode of the discharge tube. See construction in Fig. <a href='#i052'>H</a>, at beginning
of this chapter, the tube being about 40 cm. long and 3
cm. in diameter. He was very careful in every case to chemically
purify and dry the particular gas. He omitted the perforated disk
and provided an opaque strip of the phosphorescent screen on the
side toward the window and made his observations from the
other side, the object of the experiment being particularly to
test the transmission of cathode rays in different gases. With
any particular gas, he moved the phosphorescent screen along
by means of a magnet until the shadow on the screen became
invisible. It is evident that the distances of the screen from
the window for different gases would indicate the relative transmitting
powers. He also modified the experiment by varying
the density of the gases, hydrogen being taken as 1 as usual,
nitrogen 14, and so on. The transmitting power of hydrogen
was nearly five times as great as that of nitrogen, air, oxygen
and carbonic acid gas, which did not much differ. <a href='#E10'>§ 10</a> and <a href='#E18'>18</a>.
Sulphurous acid was a very weak transmitter. All the gases
became luminous near the window as in air. <a href='#E65top'>§ 65</a>. The colors
were all about the same as far as distinguishable, <a href='#E11'>§ 11</a>, which
was difficult in view of the brightness of the phosphorescence
on the glass. It was a universal rule, that when the density decreased,
the transmitting power increased. In high vacua, in
all gases, the rays went through the space in rectilinear lines in
all directions from the window, and generally it made no difference
what gas was employed provided the vacuum was as high
as hundredths of a millimetre. At this pressure all gases acted
the same. To be sure, the phosphorescence did not occur at
this high vacuum at a great distance as might be expected, but
it should be remembered that the intensity of the rays varied as
the square of the distance, and, therefore, at very great distances,
the action was very weak.</p>
<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span><a id='E74'></a>74. <span class='sc'>Cause of Luminosity of Gas Outside the Discharge
Tube.</span>—At ordinary pressures, in the cases of hydrogen and air,
as has been noted, the gas became luminous in the observing
tube, the effect being, of course, the same as entering open air,
represented in Fig. <a href='#i052'>A</a>, beginning of this chapter. In order to
determine the luminosity at less pressures, the gas, of whichever
kind, was enclosed in a rather long observing tube and
only at rather high vacua did the bluish and sometimes reddish
gaseous luminosity disappear. Upon grasping the tube with
the hand or approaching any conductor connected to earth, of
large capacity, the column stopped at that point so that the remainder
of the tube, beyond the hand, measured from the discharge,
was dark. The phosphorescence on the glass wall of
the tube produced by the cathode rays was not influenced in
any way by outside conductors, such as the hand. Cathode rays
themselves were not stopped apparently by the hand, because
the phosphorescent screen and glass, located beyond the hand,
became luminous. He concluded, therefore, that the glowing
of the gas had no close connection with the cathode rays. He
proved this also by deflecting the cathode rays in the discharge
tube from a certain space, and yet the gaseous luminosity remained.
As an exception, the cathode rays sometimes appeared
to be closely associated with the light column. He attributed
the luminosity of the gas in general, at low pressures, not to the
cathode rays, but directly to the electric current or some kind of
electric force, <a href='#E11'>§ 11</a> and <a href='#E14'>14</a>, which, as already remarked, permitted
sparks to be drawn from the aluminum window and surrounding
points.</p>
<p class='c013'>The negative glow light in Geissler tubes, <a href='#E30'>§ 30</a>, is also to be
regarded as gas illuminated by cathode rays. (Compare Hertz,
<i>Wied. Ann.</i>, XIX., p. 807, ’83.) Between that phenomenon and
the glow observed here and attributed to irradiation, there exists
a correspondence, inasmuch as in both cases the light disappears
at high exhaustions, <a href='#E53'>§ 53</a>, appears fainter and larger
when the pressure increases, <a href='#E54'>§ 54</a>, and then becomes brighter
and smaller, <a href='#E54'>§ 54</a>. But, whereas, the glow in the Geissler tube
has become very bright and small at 0.5 mm. pressure, the gas
in our experiment remains much darker up to 760 mm. pressure,
and yet the illuminated spot is much larger. This difference
cannot, therefore, be attributed to an inferior intensity of the
rays here used. But it will be explained, <a href='#E76'>§ 76</a>, as soon as we
can show that at higher pressures cathode rays of a different
kind are produced, which are much more strongly absorbed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>gases than the rays investigated hitherto and produced at very
low pressures.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fig. I, p. <a href='#Page_52'>52</a>, illustrates the apparatus by which he studied the
rectilinear propagation and whereby he found that it was rectilinear
only in a very high vacuum. In the figure, the gas is at
ordinary pressure, and it will be noticed that the turbidity of
the same is indicated by the curved lines while the dotted lines
show the volume that would be occupied by light or other rectilinear
rays, unaccompanied by any kind of diffusion. In the
observing tube, there was a disc having a central hole at <i>a</i>.
Beyond this disc, measured from the aluminum window, was a
fluorescent screen which, as well as the perforated disc, could
be moved to different distances by means of a magnet acting on
a little iron base. It is evident that upon moving the fluorescent
screen to different distances, the diameter of the luminous
patch would be a measure of the amount of turbidity. The
curved lines intersecting the peripheries of the luminous spots
indicate, therefore, the field of the cathode rays, so that said
field would appear like a kind of curved cone if the same were
visible. Although hydrogen is the least turbid gas, yet the
phosphorescent patches were all larger except with a high vacuum
than they could have been with rectilinear propagation.
An additional characteristic of the phosphorescent spot, was its
being made up of a central bright spot and a halo less luminous,
appearing like some of the pictures of a nebula, see Fig. I´, p. <a href='#Page_52'>52</a>,
the darker or centre indicating the brighter portion. In a perfect
vacuum the halo did not exist. He performed a similar
experiment with ordinary light. No halo occurred on a paper
screen which was used instead of the phosphorescent screen,
but upon introducing a glass trough of dilute milk between the
window and the perforated disc, or between the disc and the
paper screen, nuclei and halos were obtained, illustrating a case
of the effect of a turbid fluid upon light, and assisting in proving
that gases act as a turbid medium to cathode rays as milk
and similar substances do to light; also in other gases than hydrogen,
and by the use of cathode rays, nuclei and halos were
not obtained at high exhaustion, all the gases becoming limpid.
Taking into account pressure and density, all gases behaved the
same as to the power of transmission when they were of the
same density, without any regard whatever to their chemical
nature. Density alone determined the matter, according to
Lenard.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E75'></a>75. <span class='sc'>Cathode Rays of Different Kinds are Variably Diffused.</span>—He
discovered the remarkable property, contrary to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>expectation, that if the rays are generated at high pressures,
they are capable of more diffusion than when generated at lower
pressures. This can be easily proved by any one, for it will be
noticed that upon increasing the pressure in the discharge tubes
the spots on the phosphorescent screen will not only grow darker
but larger and more indefinite as to the nucleus and halo. He
called attention to the agreement with Hertz, who also found
that there were two different kinds of rays, see <i>Wied. Ann.</i>, XIX,
p. 816, ’83, also see Hertz’s experiment. Lenard also pointed
out the analogue in respect to light, which, when of short wave
length, is more diffused in certain turbid media than that of
greater wave length. Although Lenard held that his experiment
proved that cathode rays were phenomena in some way
connected with the ether, yet he pointed out an important difference
in connection with the property of deflection of the rays by
the molecules even of elementary gases like hydrogen, producing
diffusion of the rays, which accordingly may be considered
as behaving like light in passing through, not gases, but vapors,
liquids and dust. In the case of the cathode rays the molecules
of a gas acted as a turbid medium, but in the case of light, turbidity
is only exhibited by vapors or certain liquids, as so eloquently
explained by Tyndall, in “Fragments of Science,” 1871,
where it is shown that <i>aggregation</i> of molecules, like vapors or
dust in the presence of light, make themselves known by color
and diffusion, whereas the substances in a molecular or atomic
state do not serve to show the presence of rays of light.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E76'></a>76. <span class='sc'>Law of Propagation.</span>—Lenard recognized continually
that there were two kinds of cathode rays. One of them may
have been X-rays without his knowing it. In the latter part of
’95, he made some experiments especially of a quantitative nature
as to the principle of absorption of the rays by gases. By
mathematical analysis, based upon experiments, he arrived at
the principle that the absorptivity of a gas is proportional to its
pressure, or what is the same thing, to its density, or as to another
way of stating the law, “the same mass of gas absorbs at
all pressures the same quantity of cathode rays.” See <i>Elect.
Rev.</i>, Lon., as cited, p. 100.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E77'></a>77. <span class='sc'>Charged Bodies Discharged by Cathode Rays.</span>—An
insulated metallic plate was charged first with positive electricity
and in another experiment with negative electricity. In
each instance, the plate was discharged rapidly by the cathode
rays as indicated by the electroscope, and the same held true
when a wire cage in contact with the aluminum window, surrounded
the electroscope and the metallic plate. The effect was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>stopped by cutting off the cathode rays by quartz .5 mm. thick.
The discharge took place, however, through aluminum foil. A
magnet was made to deflect the internal cathode rays, whereupon
the discharge did not take place, all showing that the discharge
of the insulated plate was directly due to those rays. A
remarkable occurrence was the accomplishment of <i>the discharge
at a much greater distance than that at which phosphorescence was exhibited</i>.
See also Roentgen’s experiment—who suggested that
Lenard had to do with X-rays in this experiment, but thought
they were cathode rays. The maximum distance for the discharge
was about 30 cm. measured normally to the aluminum
window. He caused a discharge of a plate also in rarefied air.
He admitted that the experiments were not carried far enough
to know whether the effect was due to the action of the cathode
rays upon the surface of the window, or upon the surrounding
air, or upon the plate. The author could not find in Lenard’s
paper any positive or negative proof that he had actually deflected
the external cathode rays by a magnet while passing
through air or gas at ordinary pressure. He had deflected them
while passing through a very high vacuum in the observing
tube. Dr. Lodge, who briefly reviewed Lenard’s experiments,
expressed the same opinion. See <i>The Elect.</i>, Lon., Jan. 31, ’96,
p. 439. For theoretical considerations of the electric nature of
light, the discharge law in the photo-electric phenomena, the

<p class='c013'><a id='E78'></a>78. <span class='sc'>De Kowalskie’s Experiment. Source, Propagation
and Direction of Cathode Rays.</span> <i>Acad. Sci.</i>, Paris, Jan. 14,
’95; <i>So. Fran. Phys.</i> Jan. ’95; <i>Nature</i>, Lon. Jan. 24, ’95; Feb. 21, ’95.—The
conclusions he arrived at are, 1. The production of the
cathode rays does not depend on the discharge from metallic
electrodes across a rarefied gas, nor is their production connected
with the disintegration of metallic electrodes. 2. They
are produced chiefly where the primary illumination attains
suitable intensity, that is, where the density of the current lines
is very considerable. 3. Their direction of propagation is that
of the current lines at the place where the rays are produced,
from the negative to the positive poles. They are propagated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>in the opposite direction to that in which the positive luminosity
is supposed to flow. <a href='#E43'>§ 43</a>. He employed a Goldstein tube reduced
at the centre. <a href='#E41'>§ 41</a>. It was found that the cathode rays are
formed not only at the negative electrode, but also at the constriction,
directly opposite the cathode. De Kowalskie carried
on further experiments in this line in order to be satisfied with
the principles named above, which he formulated. In one tube,
he was able to produce cathode rays at either end of the capillary
tube forming the constricted part of a long vacuum tube.
No electrodes were employed. The tube was merely placed
near a discharger through which “Tesla currents” were passed?
He seems to have been working with X-rays without knowing
it; for his results agree with those of Roentgen and later experimenters
that the source of X-rays is the surface of a substance
where it is struck by cathode rays. The statements were about
as definite as could be expected at that date.</p>

9, 96.—<span class='sc'>Uninfluenced By A Magnet In Open Air.</span>—Although
Lenard recognized several kinds of cathode rays, which differed
as to penetrating and phosphorescing power, yet he always held,
or inferred at least that they were deflected by a magnet, outside,
as well as inside, (proved <a href='#E72a'>§ 72<i>a</i></a>.) of the discharge tube. <a href='#E59'>§ 59</a>.
Prof. Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen subjected his newly discovered
rays to the action of very strong magnetic fields in the open air,
but no deviation was detected. This is the characteristic which
more than anything else has served to distinguish X-rays from
cathode rays. This property has been confirmed by others. He
employed the principle of magnetic attraction of internal cathode
§ <a href='#E59'>59</a>, rays to shift the phosphorescent spot, for then he noticed
that the source of X-rays fluctuated also.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E80'></a>80. <span class='sc'>Source of X-Rays may Be At Points Within The
Vacuum Space.</span>—In one case, he employed a Lenard tube, and
found that the X-rays were generated from the window which
was in the path of the cathode rays. <a href='#E67'>§ 67</a>. Different bodies within
the discharge tube were found to have different quantitative
powers of radiating X-rays when struck by the cathode rays.
He stated “If for example, we let the cathode rays fall on a
plate, one half consisting of a 0.3 mm. sheet of platinum and
the other half a 1 mm. sheet of aluminum, the pin-hole photograph
of this double plate will show that the sheet of platinum
emits a far greater number of X-rays than does the aluminum,
this remark applying in every case to the side upon which the
cathode rays impinge.” On the reverse side, however, of the
platinum, no rays were emitted, but a large amount was radiated
from the reverse side of the aluminum. <a href='#E67'>§ 67</a>. He admitted
that the explanation was simple; but, at the same time, he
pointed out that this, together with other experiments, showed
that platinum is the best for generating the most powerful X-rays.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>One form with which he experimented
is illustrated in Fig. <a href='#i070'>J</a>, in principle, being
described as a bulb in which a concave
cathode was opposite a sheet of
platinum, placed at an angle of 45° to
the axis of the curved cathode, and at
the focus thereof.</p>

</div>
<p class='c013'><a id='E81'></a>81. <span class='sc'>Reflection of X-Rays.</span>—He emphasized the knowledge
that there is a certain kind and a certain amount of reflection,
such as that produced upon light and, as pointed out by Lenard,
upon cathode rays, by certain turbid media. The following quotation
sets forth the exact experiment to show slight reflection
at metal surfaces. “I exposed a plate, protected by a black
paper sheet 1 to the X-rays (<i>e.g.</i> from bulb J) so that the glass
side 2 lay next to the discharge tube. The sensitive film was
partly covered with star-shaped pieces (4 slightly displaced in
the Fig.) of platinum, lead, zinc and aluminum. On the developed
negative the star-shaped impressions showed dark (comparatively)
under platinum, lead and more markedly, under zinc;
the aluminum gave no image. It seems, therefore, that the
former three metals can reflect the X-rays; as, however, another
explanation is possible, I repeated the experiment with only this
difference, that a film of thin aluminum foil was interposed between
the sensitive film and the metal stars. Such an aluminum
plate is opaque to the ultra-violet rays, but transparent to X-rays.
In the result the images appeared as before, this pointing still
to the existence of reflection at metal surfaces.”</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E82'></a>82. <span class='sc'>Penetrating Power.</span> The transmitted energy was tested
both by a fluorescent screen and by a sensitive photographic
plate. Either one was acted upon by the rays after transmission
through what have ordinarily been called opaque objects. <a href='#E68'>§ 68</a>.
for example, 1000 pages of a book. As in Lenard’s results, so in
Roentgen’s, the color of the object had no effect, even when the
material was black. <a href='#E68'>§ 68</a>, near beginning. A single thickness
of tinfoil scarcely cast a shadow on the screen. <a href='#E66a'>§ 66<i>a</i></a>. The same
was true with reference to a pine board 2 or 3 cm. thick. They
passed also through aluminum 15 mm. thick. <a href='#E63b'>63<i>b</i></a>. Glass was comparatively
opaque, <a href='#E66a'>§ 66<i>a</i></a>, as compared with its power of transmitting
light, but nevertheless it must be remembered that the
rays passed through considerable thickness of glass. The tissues
of the body, water <a href='#E68'>§ 68</a>, near centre, and certain other liquids
and gases were found exceedingly permeable <a href='#E67'>§ 67</a>. Fluorescence
could be detected through platinum 2 mm. thick and lead 1.5
mm. thick. Through air the screen was illuminated at a maximum
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>distance of 1 m. A rod of wood painted with white lead
cast a great deal more shadow than without the paint, and in
general, bones, salts of the metals, whether solid or in solution,
metals themselves and minerals generally were among the most
resisting materials. <a href='#E155'>§ 155</a>. The experiments were performed
in a dark room by excluding the luminosity of the tube by a
thick cloth or card board entirely surrounding the tube. He
performed the wonderful experiment, so often since repeated,
of holding the hand between the screen of barium platino cyanide
and the discharge tube, and beholding the shadow picture
of the bones. This was the accidental step which initiated the
new department of photography, and which gave to the whole
science of electric discharge, a new interest among scientists and
electricians and which thoroughly awakened popular interest.
The whole world concedes to him the honor of being the originator
of the new art. In view of sciagraphs of the bones of the
hand upon the screen, it occurred to him in view also of Lenard’s
experiments, on the photographic plate, to produce a permanent
picture of the skeleton of the hand with the flesh faintly outlined.
<a href='#E84'>§ 84</a>. The accompanying half tone illustration, page <a href='#Page_37'>37</a>,
was made by the <i>Elect. Eng</i>. N.Y. (June 3, ’96) by permission,
and it represents the Edison X-ray exhibit at the New York
Electrical Exposition of the Electric Light Association, 1896.
Thousands of people, through the beneficence of Dr. Edison,
were permitted to see the shadows of their bones surrounded by
living flesh. The screen was made of calcic tungstate. The
hand and arm were placed behind and viewed from the front.
<a href='#E132'>§ 132</a>, near beginning.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E83'></a>83. <span class='sc'>Penetrating Power and Density of Substances.</span>—Although
he found that there was some general relation between
the thickness of materials and the penetrating power, yet he
was satisfied that the variation of the power did not bear a direct
relation to the density, (referring to solids) especially as he
noticed a peculiar result when shadows were cast by Iceland
spar, glass, aluminum and quartz of equal thickness. The Iceland
spar cast the least shadow upon suitable fluorescent or photographic
plate. The increased thickness of any one substance
increased the darkness of the shadow, as exhibited by tinfoil in
layers forming steps. Other metals, namely platinum, lead,
zinc and aluminum foil were similarly arranged and a table of
the results recorded. <a href='#E63b'>§ 63<i>b</i></a>.</p>

<p class='c013'>He concluded from these data that the permeability increased
much more rapidly than the thickness decreased.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E84'></a>84. <span class='sc'>Fluorescence and Chemical Action.</span> <a href='#E70'>§ 70</a> and <a href='#E63a'>63<i>a</i></a>.—Among
the substances that fluoresced were barium platino cyanide,
calcium sulphide, uranium glass, Iceland spar and rock
salt. In producing sciagraphs on the photographic plates, he
found it entirely unnecessary to remove the usual ebonite cover,
which, although black, and so opaque to light, produced scarcely
any resistance to the rays. The sensitive plate, even when protected
in a box, could not be kept near a discharge tube, for he
noticed that it became clouded. He was not sure whether the
effect upon the sensitive plate was directly due to the X-rays or
to a secondary action, namely, the fluorescent light which must
have been produced upon the glass plate having the film, it being
well known that light of fluorescence possesses chemical
power. He called attention to the fact that inasmuch as fluorescent
light which can be reflected, refracted, polarized, etc.,
was produced by the rays; therefore, all the X-rays which fell
upon a body did not leave it as such. <a href='#E67'>§ 67</a>. No effect was produced
upon the retina of the eye although he temporarily concluded
that the rays must have struck the retina in view of the
great permeability of animal tissue and liquids. <a href='#E68'>§ 68</a>, at end.
Conclusions of this kind not based on experiment, are never reliable,
even when offered by very high authorities. Again the
rays were weak. Roentgen himself admitted that the salts of
metals in solution (<a href='#E82'>§ 82</a>, near centre) rendered the latter rather
opaque. The eye ball is continually moistened with the solution
of common salt. Further than this, Mr. Pignolet noticed
in <i>Comptes Rendus</i>, Feb. 24, ’96, an account of an experiment of
Darien and de Rochas. In anatomy it is common to experiment
on fresh pig’s eyes in order to make comparisons with human
eyes. The above named Frenchmen submitted the former to
X-rays. The eyes were but slightly permeable thereto.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='E85'></a>85. <span class='sc'>Non-refraction and But Little Reflection of X-rays.</span>—He
employed a very powerful refracting prism made of
mica and containing carbon bi-sulphide and water. The same
prism refracted light but did not refract X-rays. No one would
think of making prisms for examining light, of ebonite or aluminum,
but he made such a prism for testing X-rays. But if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>there were any refraction he concluded that the refractive index
could not have been more than 1.05, which may be considered
as a proof that the rays cannot be refracted. He tried heavier
metals, but the difficulty of arriving at any satisfactory results
was due to the resistance of such metals to the transmission of
the rays. Among other tests was one consisting in passing the
rays through layers of powdered materials through which the
rays were transmitted in the same quantity as through the same
substances not powdered. It is well known that light passed
into powdered transparent materials, is enormously cut off,
deviated, diffused, refracted etc., in view of the innumerable
small surfaces of the particles. Hence he concluded that there
was little if anything in the nature of refraction or reflection of
X-rays. <a href='#E146'>§ 146</a>. The powdered materials employed were rock
salt, and fine electrolytic and zinc dust. The shadows, both on
the screen and as recorded on the photographic plate were of
substantially the same shade as given by the same materials of
the same thickness in the coherent state. One of the most usual
ways of testing refraction of light is by means of a lens. X-rays
could not be brought to a focus with the lens of what ever material
it was made. Among the substances tried were ebonite
and glass. As expected, therefore, the sciagraph of a round rod
was darker in the middle than at the edges; and a hollow cylinder
filled with a more transparent liquid showed the centre portion
brighter than its edges. If one considers this observation
in connection with others, namely the transparency of powders,
and the state of the surface not being effective in altering the
passage of the X-rays through a body, it leads to the probable
conclusion that regular reflection does not exist, but that bodies
behave to the X-rays as turbid media to light, <a href='#E69'>§ 69</a>.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E86'></a>86. <span class='sc'>Velocity of X-Rays In Different Bodies.</span> p. 46.—Although
he performed no direct experiment in this direction
yet he inferred in view of the absence of refraction at the surfaces
of different media, that the rays travel with equal velocities
in all bodies.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E87'></a>87. <span class='sc'>Double Refraction and Polarization.</span>—Neither could
he detect any action upon the rays by way of refraction by Iceland
spar at whatever angle the crystal was placed. As to this
property of light see Huygen’s Works of 1690 and Malus’ Works
of 1810. quartz also gave negative results. Prof. Mayer of
Stevens Institute submitted to <i>Sci.</i>, Mar. 27, ’96, the report of a
crucial test for showing the non-polarization of X-rays. On
six discs of glass, 0.15 mm. thick and 25 mm. in diameter, were
placed very thin plates of Herapath’s iodo-sulphate of quinine.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>The axes of these crystals crossed one another at various angles.
When the axes of two plates were crossed at right angles no light
was transmitted; the overlapping surfaces of the plates appearing
black. If the Roentgen rays be polarizable, the Herapath
crystals, crossed at right angles, should act as lead and not allow
any of the Roentgen rays to be transmitted. Prof. Mayer is
well known as exceedingly expert in connection with minute
measurements and in the manipulation of scientific experiments.
Dr. Morton, Pres. Stevens Inst., attested the results as an absolute
demonstration that X-rays are incapable of polarization.
<i>Stevens Indicator</i>, Jan., ’96.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E88'></a>88. <span class='sc'>The Propagation of X-Rays Rectilinear.</span>—There would
be no difficulty in producing photographs of the bones of the
hand with the rays of light, if it were not for the tremendous
amount of reflection and refraction causing so much diffusion
that no sharply defined shadow of the bones would be produced.
By means of a powerful lens and a funnel pointed into a dark
room, the author noticed that the condensed light thereby obtained
when passed through the hand, and when the incident
rays were parallel, came out so diffused that one would think
that the light went through bones as easily as any part of the
hand. An experiment of this kind serves to emphasize that the
success of sciagraphy by X-rays is due not only to the great
penetrating power, but to practically no refraction nor reflection.
In view of the sharp shadows cast of objects even when
located in vegetable or animal media, Roentgen was justified in
giving the name of ray to the energy. He tested the sharpness
of the shadow by making sciagraphs and fluorescent pictures
not only of the bones of the hand, but of a wire wound upon a
bobbin, of a set of weights in a box, of a compass, card and
needle, conveniently closed in a metal case, and of the elements
of a non-homogeneous metal. To prove the rectilinear propagation
further, he received the image of the discharge tube upon
a photographic plate by means of a pinhole camera. The picture
was faint but unmistakable.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E89'></a>89. <span class='sc'>Interference.</span> The rays of light may be caused to interfere
with each other. See <i>Newton’s Principia</i>, Vol. III.; <i>Young’s
Works</i>, Vol. I.—Theory points out that waves of ether of two
pencils of light, when caused to be propagated at certain relative
phases partially or wholly neutralize or strengthen each other.
Roentgen could obtain no interference effects of the X-rays, but
did not conclude that the interference property was absent. He
was not satisfied with the intensity of the rays and therefore
could not test the matter severely.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='E90'></a>90. <span class='sc'>Electrified Bodies Discharged by X-Rays.</span> p. <a href='#Page_47'>47</a>.—After
Roentgen’s first announcement, others, and probably J. J.
Thomson as the first, found that the X-rays would discharge
both negatively and positively electrified bodies. Roentgen, in
his second announcement, stated that he had already made such
a discovery, but had not carried the investigation far enough to
report satisfactorily on the details. At last he put forth an account
of the whole phenomena and stated that the discharge
varied somewhat with the intensity of the rays, which was tested
in each instance by the relative luminosity of the fluorescent
screen, and by the relative darkness produced upon the photographic
plate in several instances. Electrified bodies, whether
conductors or insulators, were discharged when placed in the
path of the rays. All bodies whatsoever behaved in the same
manner when charged. They were all discharged equally by
the X-rays. He noticed that “If an electrical conductor is surrounded
by a solid insulator such as paraffin instead of by air,
the radiation acts as if the insulating envelope were swept by a
flame connected to earth.” Upon surrounding said paraffin by
a conductor connected to earth, the radiation no longer acted on
the inner electrified conductor. The above observations led him
to believe that the action was indirect and had something to do
with the air through which the X-rays passed. In order to
prove this, it was necessary for him to show that air ought to be
able to discharge the bodies if first subjected to the rays, and
then passed over the bodies. The apparatus for performing an
experiment to test this prediction is shown in Fig. <a href='#i076'>L</a>, which
serves to illustrate also the manner in
which he prevented electro-static influences
of the discharge tube, leading in
wires and induction coil. <a href='#E71'>§ 71</a>, near centre.
For this purpose he built a large
room in which the walls were of zinc covered
with lead. The door for his entrance
and exit was arranged to be closed in an
air-tight manner. In the side wall opposite
the door there was a slit 4 cm. wide,
covered hermetically with a thin sheet of
aluminum for the entrance of X-rays from
the vacuum tube outside of the room. All the electrical apparatus
connected with the generation of the X-rays was outside
of the room. No force whatever came into the room, therefore,
except the X-rays through the aluminum. <a href='#E71'>§ 71</a>. In order to
show that air which had been subjected to the X-rays would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>discharge a body immediately afterwards upon coming in contact
therewith, he arranged matters so that the air was propelled
by an aspirator. He passed air along a tube made of thick
metal so that the rays could enter only through a small aluminum
window near the open end. At over a distance of 20
cm. from the window was an insulated ball charged with electricity,
and connected to any electroscope or electrometer. The
professor used a Hankel electroscope. No published sketch was
made by Roentgen; therefore, that shown in the figure was
produced by inference from the description. The operation was
as follows: The X-rays passed into the room through the aluminum
window, and then into the metal tube through its aluminum
window. When the air was at rest, the ball was not
discharged. When the aspirator was at work, however, so that
the air moved past the aluminum window and past the ball, the
latter was discharged whether electrified positively or negatively.
He modified the operation by maintaining the ball at a
constant potential by means of accumulators, while the air which
had been treated by X-rays was passed by the ball. “An electric
current was started as if the ball had been connected with
the wall of the tube by a bad conductor.” He was not sure
whether the air would retain its power to discharge bodies as
long as it remained out of contact with any bodies. He determined,
however, that any slight “disturbance” of the air by a
body having a large surface and not electrified, rendered the air
inoperative. He illustrated this by saying that “If one pushes,
for example, a sufficiently thick plug of cotton-wool so far into
the tube that the air which has been traversed by the rays must
stream through the cotton-wool before it reaches the ball, the
charge of the ball remains unchanged when suction is commenced.”
With the cotton-wool immediately in front of the window,
it had no effect, showing, therefore, that dust particles in
the air are not the cause of the communication of the force of
the discharge from the X-rays to the electrified body. Very fine
wire gauze in several thicknesses also prevented the air from
discharging the body when placed between the aluminum window
and the ball within the thick metal tube, as in the case of
the cotton plug. Similar experiments were instituted with dry
hydrogen instead of air, and, as far as he could discern, the bodies
were equally well discharged, except possibly a little slower
in hydrogen. He experienced difficulty in obtaining equally
powerful X-rays at different times. All experimenters are acquainted
with this difficulty. Further, he called attention also
to the thin layer of air which clings to the surface of the bodies,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>and which, therefore, plays an appreciable part in connection
with the discharge. <a href='#E16'>§ 16</a>, near end. In order to test the matter
further as to discharge of electrified bodies, he placed the same
in a highly exhausted bulb and found that the discharge was in
one case, for example, only 1/70 as rapid as in air and hydrogen
at ordinary pressure, thereby serving as another proof that gas
was the intermediate agency. Allowance should be made in all
experiments in connection with the discharging quality of X-rays.
The surrounding gas should be taken into account.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E90a'></a>90<i>a</i>. <span class='sc'>Application of Principle of Discharge by X-Rays.</span>—Professor
Robb, of Trinity College, (<i>Science</i>, Apr. 10, ’96), proposed
and explained and practically tested the principle of the
discharge of X-rays to determine the relative transparencies of
substances to X-rays. He plotted a curve in which the co-ordinate
represented the charge of the condenser in micro-coulombs,
and the abscissæ the time between charging and discharging
the condenser. The same plan could be adopted, he
suggested, for making quantitative measurements of the intensity
of X-rays from different tubes or the same discharge tube
at different times. J. J. Borgmann, of St. Petersburg, probably
was the first to show that X-rays charged as well as discharged
bodies. See <i>The Elect.</i>, Lon., Feb. 14, ’96, p. 501. Soon, a similar
announcement was made by Prof. Righi, of Bologna. <a href='#E90'>§ 90</a>.</p>

M. Pignolet.—A positively charged zinc disk connected to an
electroscope lost its charge almost instantly and acquired a
negative charge. When the charge on the zinc disk was negative,
the loss was much slower and was not complete, a certain
charge remaining. When the rays fell upon two small platinum
balls connected to the terminals of an induction coil but separated
beyond its sparking distance, sparking took place between
them, showing that X-rays, like ultra-violet rays, increase the
sparking distance of static charges.</p>

a Mascart electrometer connected with the bodies upon which

negative charges were not only completely dissipated but the
bodies acquired positive charges. Disks in the neutral state were
charged positively by the X-rays the same as takes place with
ultra-violet rays. The final positive potential was greater for
copper than for zinc and still greater for retort carbon (“<i>le carbon
de cornue</i>”) <a href='#E90c'>90<i>c</i></a>. at end. The various results are not conflicting
if the particular materials are taken into accounts. <a href='#E90c'>90<i>c</i></a> at end.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E90c'></a>90<i>c</i>. The experiments of Prof. Minchin, an expert in such
measurements, are properly described here, in that they seem to
clear up the superficial ambiguity. He formulated the conclusion
(<i>The Elect.</i>, Lon., Mar. 27, ’96, p. 736) thus:—“The X-rays
charge some bodies positively and some negatively, and whatever
charge a body may receive by other means, the X-rays
change it, both in magnitude and sign, to the charge which they
independently give to the body.” Thus, in the case of magnesium,
if the same is first positively charged by any suitable
means, then will the X-rays not only discharge it, but electrify
it negatively, while if this metal is first negatively charged, the
X-rays either diminish or increase the discharge. It must be
remembered, however, that this is not true with all metals, for
he found that gold, silver, copper, platinum, iron, aluminum,
bismuth, steel and antimony, are all positively electrified.</p>

dissipated entirely the charge of electrified bodies in their path,

the following law. The rapidity of the dissipation of the electric
charge of an electrified body under the same condition varies as
the square root of the density of the gas surrounding the body.
The dissipation of the electric charge depends upon the nature
of the electrified body, due to a sort of absorbing power

the nature of the surrounding gas, due to the density of the gas

<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>9, ’96, an account of his focus tube, the Kings College published
a description of an exactly similar one, represented in the cut.
See <i>Elec. Rev.</i>, Lon., Mar. 13. ’96, p. 340. The cathode is concave
and the anode is formed of platinum and is plane and at
such an angle that the X-rays generated, <a href='#E63'>§ 63<i>b</i></a>., on diffusion of
internal cathode rays, will be thrown out through the thin walls
of the bulb. <a href='#E55'>§ 55</a> and <a href='#E57'>57</a>. As the rays emanate from a point, the
shadows are much clearer, especially in conjunction with powerful
rays permitting several feet between the object and the tube.
Mr. Shallenberger was among the first, and was the first as far
as the author knows (<i>Elect. World</i>, Mar. 7, ’96, see cut reproduced)
to originate the use of an X-ray focus tube.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='E91a'></a>91<i>a</i>. <span class='sc'>Apparatus Employed.</span>—Prof. Roentgen paid tribute to
Tesla, by alluding to the advantages resulting from the use of
the Tesla condenser and transformer. In the first place, he
noticed that the discharge apparatus became less hot, and that
there was less probability of its being pierced. Again the vacuum
lasted longer, at least in the case of his particular apparatus.
Above all, stronger X-rays were produced. Again careful
adjustment of the vacuum was not as necessary as with the
Ruhmkorff coil.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E92'></a>92. <span class='sc'>X-Rays and Longitudinal Vibrations.</span>—Prof. Roentgen
did not consider X-rays and ultra-violet rays to be of the same
nature, although they produced many common effects. The
X-rays, as he found, by the above related experiments, behaved
quite differently from the ultra-violet rays, which are highly
refrangible, practically all subject to reflection, capable of being
polarized, and absorbed according to the density of the absorbents.
For valid reasons, the X-rays cannot be infra-red rays.
While he does not affirm any theory, yet he suggests the theory
of longitudinal waves for explaining the properties of X-rays.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>(This was not suggested again in his second announcement.) He
stated that the hypothesis needs a more solid foundation before
acceptance. The reason why Roentgen termed the energy X-rays
is simply because X in algebra represents an unknown
quantity.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='E93'></a>93. At the Johns Hopkins University, U. S., in 1884, Sir
William Thomson, (Kelvin) delivered a lecture in which he
argued that the production of longitudinal vibrations, by electrical
means, is reasonable and possible of occurrence. J. T. Bottomly,
in <i>Nature</i>, Lon. Feb., (see also <i>Elect. Eng.</i>, N.Y., Feb. 19, ’96, p.
187) called attention to this lecture as being of interest in view
of Roentgen’s suggestion about longitudinal vibrations. Lord
Kelvin called attention to what had been developed in connection
with the electro-magnetic theory of light and referred to his
own work in 1854, in connection with the propagation of electric
impulses along an insulated wire surrounded by gutta percha,
but he said that at that time no one knew the relation between
electro-static and electro-magnetic units. The part of the lecture
referring particularly to the possibility of longitudinal waves in
luminiferous ether by electrical means reads as follows. “Suppose
that we have at any place in air, or in luminiferous ether
(I cannot now distinguish between the two ideas) a body that,
through some action we need not describe, but which is conceivable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>is alternately, positively and negatively electrified;
may it not be that this will give rise to condensational waves?
Suppose, for example, that we have two spherical conductors
united by a fine wire, and that an alternating <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> is produced
in that fine wire, for instance, by an alternate current dynamo-electric
machine, and suppose that sort of thing goes on away
from all other disturbance—at a great distance up in the air,
for example. The result of the action of the dynamo-electric
machine will be that one conductor will be alternately, positively
and negatively electrified, and the other conductor negatively
and positively electrified. It is perfectly certain, if we turn the
machine slowly, that in the air in the neighborhood of the conductors,
we shall have alternately, positively and negatively
directed electric force with reversals of, for example, two or
three hundred per second of time, with a gradual transition
from negative, through zero to positive, and so on; and the
same thing all through space; and we can tell exactly what the
potential and what the electric force are at each instant at any
point. Now, does any one believe that, if that revolution were
made fast enough, the electro-static law of force, pure and
simple, would apply to the air at different distances from each
globe? Every one believes that if the process can be conducted
fast enough, several million times, or millions of millions times
per second, we should have large deviations from the electro-static
law in the distribution of electric force through the air in the
neighborhood. It seems absolutely certain that such an action
as that going on would give rise to electrical waves. Now, it
does seem to me probable that these electrical waves are condensational
waves in luminiferous ether; and probably it would
be that the propagation of these waves would be enormously
faster than the propagation of ordinary light waves.” Notice
that the above was written twelve years prior to Roentgen’s
discovery.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E94'></a>94. Prof. Schuster, in <i>Nature</i>, Lon., Jan. ’96, stated that the
great argument against the supposition of waves of very small
length lies in the absence of refraction, but questioned whether
this objection is conclusive. He further stated: “The properties
of the ether may remain unaltered within the greater part of
the sphere of action of a molecule. The number of molecules
lying within a wave length of ordinary light is not greater than
the number of motes which lie within a sound wave, but, as far
as I know, the velocity of sound is not materially affected by
the presence of dust in the air. Hence there seems nothing
impossible in the supposition that light waves, smaller than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>those we know of, may traverse solids with the same velocity as
a vacuum. We know that absorption bands greatly affect the
refractive index in neighboring regions; and as probably the
whole question of refraction resolves itself into one of resonance
effects, the rate of propagation of waves of very small lengths
does not seem to me to be prejudged by our present knowledge.
If Roentgen rays contain waves of very small length, the vibrations
in the molecule which respond to them, would seem to be
of a different order of magnitude from those so far known. Possibly,
we have here the vibration of the electron with the molecule,
instead of the molecule carrying with it that of the electron.”</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E95'></a>95. Prof. J. J. Thomson showed how it was possible that
“longitudinal waves can exist in a medium containing moving
charged ions, and in any medium, provided the wave length is
so small as to be compared with molecular dimensions, and provided
the ether in the medium is in motion. It follows from the
equation of the electro-magnetic field that the ether is set in
motion in a varying electric field. These short waves would not
be refracted, but in this respect they do not differ from transverse
waves, which on the electro-magnetic theory would not
be refracted if the wave length were comparable with molecular
distances.” From <i>Elect. Eng.</i>, N.Y., Mar. 18, ’96, p. 286, in
reference to a paper before the <i>Cam. Phil. So.</i></p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E96'></a>96. One of the very first questions asked in reference to a
discovery is as to its practical utility. Already, we have important
applications in one of the most humane directions, and that
is in connection with diagnosis. Sciagraphs can also be employed
in schools for the purpose of education, in some departments of
anatomy, etc. The interest that it excites and the amusement
that it affords are not to be overlooked, for anything in the
nature of recreation possesses utility. However, we may greatly
thank all experimenters who have investigated the subject, and
who have not left its development alone to Roentgen; for predictions
as to the utility of a discovery, however, apparently
exaggerated, are very often proved, by subsequent developments,
to have been underrated. Upon this point Prof. Boltzmann,
in <i>Zeit. Elect.</i>, Jan. 15, ’96, see also, <i>The Elec.</i>, Lon., Jan.
31, ’96, p. 447, stated, “If we remember to what discoveries the
most insignificant new natural phenomenon, such as the attraction
of small objects by rubbed amber, of iron by the lode-stone,
the convulsive twitches of a frog’s leg due to electric discharges,
the influence of the electric current upon the magnetic needle,
electro-magnetic induction etc., has led us, one can imagine to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>what applications an agent will be turned, which a few weeks
after its discovery has given rise to such surprising results.”</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E97'></a>97. Soon after hearing, (about the first of Feb. ’96,) of the
Roentgen discovery, it occurred to the author to carry on experiments
with fluorescence, but finding that it was inconvenient
to work in a perfectly dark room, and, recognizing that black
cardboard had practically no effect upon absorbing the X-rays,
he devised a sciascope (<i>daily papers</i>, Feb. 13, and <i>Elect. Eng.</i>, Feb.
19) which he afterwards learned was independently invented
and used at about the same time by Prof. William F. Magie, of
Princeton University, (see <i>Amer. Jour. Med. Sci.</i>, Feb. 7, ’96 and
Feb. 15, ’96) and by Prof. E. Salvioni, of Italy under the name
of cryptoscope, (see <i>Med. Sur. Acad.</i> of Perugia, Italy, Feb. 8, ’96.)
In about a month afterwards (<i>Elect. Eng.</i>, N.Y., Apr. 1, ’96, p.
340) the instrument (with phosphorescent calcic tungstate <a href='#E13'>§ 13</a>.
in place of fluorescent barium platino cyanide) was again published
under the name of the Edison fluoroscope. There are
probably many other claimants—some professor in London—name
forgotten. They all consist of a tapering tube with a
sight hole at one end and a fluorescent screen in the other, which
is closed by opaque card board. (Frontispiece at Chap. X). For
the sake of conformity, the words sciagraph and sciagraphy and
similar derivatives, and in view of the meaning of the radical
definitions, have been employed throughout the book. The objection
to the word fluoroscope is that the instrument is practically
universally employed in seeing the shadows of objects,
otherwise invisible to the naked eye, rather than to test fluorescence.
The name sciascope was early suggested by Prof. Magie.
For those who wish to make a screen, the author may state that
he obtained a good one by mixing pulverized barium platino
cyanide with varnish and spreading the mixture over a sheet of
tracing cloth.</p>

Macmillan, p. 63, ’93. From notes by Mr. N. D. C. Hodges.—This
is the all-important initial work of H. Hertz. The source
of light was a spark, and the great discovery resulted from a
combination of circumstances and was unsought; but by studying
and testing the matter, he found the cause. Two induction
coils, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, having interrupter <i>d</i>, were included in the same circuit,
as shown in the figure. The sparking of the active one (<span class='fss'>A</span>)
increased the length of the spark of the passive (<span class='fss'>B</span>) <a href='#E10'>§ 10</a>. He
sought the cause. The discharge was more marked as the distance
between the sparks was reduced. Sparks between the
knobs had the same effect as those between points; but the
effect was best displayed when the spark <span class='fss'>B</span> was between knobs.
The relation between the two sparks was reciprocal. The discharging
effect of the active spark (<span class='fss'>A</span>) spread out on all sides,
according to the laws of light,
first suggesting that light
was the cause. Most solid
bodies acted as screens, s.
Liquid and gases served
more or less as screens. The
intensity of the action increased
by the rarefaction of
the air around the passive
spark, <i><i>i.e.</i></i>, in a discharge
tube. The radiations from
the spark, <span class='fss'>A</span>, reflected from
most surfaces, according to the laws of light, and refracted according
to the same laws, caused the discharge. The ultra-violet
light of the spark <span class='fss'>A</span> was inferred to be the active agent in
producing the discharge. The same effect was produced by
other sources of light than the electric spark. The conclusions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>were afterwards confirmed by many, and subordinate discoveries

Hertz. Principal result was that the effect depended on the
illumination of the cathode (<a href='#E99'>§ 99</a>.) The illumination of the
anode or of the spark-gap did not influence the discharge. The
very character of the charge was altered by the action of light
upon the cathode. The influence of the illumination of the
cathode did not consist solely at the starting of the spark, but
lasted as long as the sparks continued to pass. With decreasing
pressure of surrounding gas, the effect first increased (<a href='#E97a'>§ 97<i>a</i></a>) to
a maximum, and then decreased (<a href='#E54'>§ 54</a>). The illumination had
an effect on the path of the sparks, the path being perpendicular
to the rays of light. The best results were obtained with
carbonic acid gas. Hydrogen was next, and then air. They
were contained in the tubes surrounding the poles. The character
of the gas also had an influence on the rays which would
produce the effect, with carbonic acid gas the effect showing
itself even with the visible rays.</p>

451.—The elements employed for carrying on the experiment
consisted of a delicate electroscope and certain metals, including
aluminum, amalgamated zinc, magnesium, rubidium, potassium
and sodium. Some of the experiments were made on the
top of Mount Sonnblick, the same being 3,100 m. high, where the
discharging power of light was found to be about twice as great
as at Wolfenbuttel, which was at the level of 80 m. The whole
time for the discharge was only a matter of a few seconds. The
greater rapidity of discharge at the higher level was attributed
to the greater proportion of ultra-violet rays (Hertz),
which are the most easily absorbed by the atmosphere, according
to Langley. All metals are not discharged alike by the
action of light. The law follows the electro-positive series in
such a way that the more electro-positive the metal, the longer
the wave length of light necessary to produce the discharge.
In experiments with potassium, sodium and rubidium, they
made them successively, the cathode in a bulb of rarefied hydrogen.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>In this case it was found that the light of a candle,
even at so great a distance as 7 m., would cause the discharge.
Rubidium was sensitive in this respect to the red light from a
heated rod of glass. Elster and Geitel were able also to discharge,
by light, some non-metallic bodies, like calcic sulphide,
when so prepared that it had the property of phosphorescing,
and also darkly colored fluorites. Independently, the phenomenon
is of importance, because Elster and Geitel determined
that there was some common cause as to the discharge of bodies
of light and the discharge from the earth’s surface. A series of
experiments lasting three years, consisted in investigating the
relation of the ultra-violet rays from the sun simultaneously to
the quantity of charge in the atmosphere. The results acted as
evidence of the explanation of the daily and annual variation
of atmospheric potentials. These experiments are of importance
in connection with X-rays, because Röntgen and Prof. J.
J. Thomson subsequently, and possibly others independently,
discovered that X-rays produce, not only a like, but a more
extended action in that there is not so great a difference between
their power to discharge negatively and positively electrified
bodies. <a href='#E90a'>§ 90<i>a</i></a>. In the further developments of their
ideas, they tried the action of diffused day-light upon a Geissler
tube traversed by vibrations which were produced by a Hertz
vibrator (see recent book on Hertzian waves), the tube having
an electrode of metal of the alkaline group. They were able
to adjust the combination so that the presence of a little day-light
would initiate a luminous discharge, while in the dark such
a charge ceased. <a href='#E14a'>§ 14<i>a</i></a>.</p>

Aug. 23, ’94, p. 406.—The X-rays have properties similar to
those of light, and have their source in electricity. Quincke
discovered that light which has been polarized perpendicularly
to the plane of incidence is greatly increased as to its power of
penetrating metals. Elster and Geitel used the following apparatus
to determine the relation between polarized light and
electricity. The current varied according to the angle of incidence
and the plane of polarization. The apparatus comprised
the following elements: An exhausted bulb, provided with a
platinum anode, and a cathode consisting of potassium and sodium,
combined in the form of a liquid alloy having a bright
surface of reflection. The source of light was an oxyhydrogen
flame, which played upon zircon instead of lime; a lens
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>changed the diverging rays to parallel rays, which were polarized
by a Nichol prism and allowed to fall upon the cathode.
The electrodes of the vacuum bulb were connected to the poles
of a generator of a current of about 400 volts. “The strength,
of the current was greatest when the plane of polarization was
perpendicular to the plane of incidence—<i><i>i.e.</i></i>, when the electric
displacements constituting light, took place in the plane of incidence,
and when the angle of incidence was about 60°, <i><i>i.e.</i></i>,
the polarizing angle of the alloy itself.” Prof. Sylvanus P.
Thompson confirmed these results by experiment. The rate of
discharge was greatest, he said, when the plane of polarization
was such that the Fresnellian vibration “chopped into” the surface.
Polarized light, he reminded them, produced similar
results upon selenium.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although the domain of this book is necessarily limited to the
consideration of phenomena connected with the internal and
external energy of a discharge tube, yet if any other one subject
is of special interest and utility in connection with the consideration

the electric discharge and light, which has been thoroughly
studied only during the past few years, and the accounts of the
researches recorded in various periodicals and academy papers.

light will discharge only negatively charged bodies. While this
is practically or sometimes the case, yet these experimenters

Hallwach found with the use of the arc light, a very small loss

and an arc light as the source of illumination, caused a discharge

caused a deflection of only three degrees by the same battery.

that ultra-violet light will discharge not only negative but positive

oxides, withdraw positive charges. In the same way, for example,

After a few days, the plate acted like any other metal plate polished
or unpolished; it lost its charge very slowly, positive or
negative alike, independently of the illumination. If it is then
again polished, as for example, with emery paper and turpentine,
it loses its charge rapidly in diffused light, which has passed
through a pane of window glass, for example. Therefore, the
ultra-violet rays are not alone effective, although most effective.
The longer the time elapsing, after polishing, the slower the
discharge takes place. Zinc behaved likewise, only more slowly.
Other metals were tried. Bismuth acted differently from most
metals. Whether charged positively or negatively, they exhibited
rapid loss in the dark, in dry air under a metal bell, independently
of the state of the polish.</p>

<span class='sc'>Stereoscopic Sciagraphs.</span> <i>Elect. World</i>, N.Y., Mar. 14, ’96.—Prof.
Elihu Thomson, of the Thomson-Houston Electric Company,
described experiments to determine the practicability of
making stereoscopic pictures by X-rays. A solid object may
be considered as composed of points which are at different distances
from the eye. By monocular vision, the solidity of an
object is not assured. However, by the use of both eyes, the
objects appear less flat. The experimenter used, as the different
objects, a mouse, also metal wires twisted together, and,
again, a block of wood having projecting nails. In order to
produce a stereoscopic picture with X-rays, he took a sciagraph
in the ordinary way. He then caused the relative displacement
of the discharge-tube and the object, and took another sciagraph.
By mounting the two sciagraphs in a stereoscope, he found that
the effect was as expected, and in the case especially of the
skeleton of the mouse, it was very curious,—less like a shadow
picture and more like the real object. The picture was more
realistic, as in the well-known stereoscope for viewing photographs.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='E101'></a>101. <span class='sc'>Thomson’s Experiment. Manifolding by X-rays.</span>—If
one desires to take a print of a negative, for example by means
of sun-light, it is evident that, on account of the opacity of the
photographic paper, only one sheet would be placed under the
negative for receiving a print. However, the X-rays are so
penetrating in their power that it is possible for them to produce
sciagraphs through several sheets, and thereby to result in
the production of several pictures of the same object with one
exposure. Without an experiment to prove this, one might
argue that the chemical action of one sheet would absorb all
the energy. The experiment of Prof. Thomson shows that this
is not so. The elements were arranged as follows: First a
discharge tube; then an object, namely, a key escutcheon of
iron; then yellow paper; then paste board; then black paper;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>then two layers of albumen or sensitized paper; then two
célérité printing papers; then two platinum printing papers;
then one célérité; then six layers of sensitive bromide paper;
then four layers of heavy sensitive bromide paper (heavier);
then three layers of black paper, and finally, at the maximum
distance from the discharge-tube, a sensitive glass plate of dry
gelatine, with its face up, thereby making twenty-five layers in
the aggregate. It is interesting to notice that an induction coil
was not employed, but a small Wimshurst machine, having connected
to each pole a small Leyden jar. <a href='#E106'>§ 106</a>. 1,200 discharges
occurred during exposure. The results were as follows:
No sciagraphs developed upon the albumen, célérité nor
platinum, which, it should be noticed, were merely printing
papers. <a href='#E128'>§ 128</a>. The impressions on the ten bromide papers
were weak. See Multiple Sciagraphs, Fig. <a href='#i094b'>2</a>, p. <a href='#Page_94'>94</a>. He attributed
the reason of this to the thinness of the film. Although
the glass plate was furthest away from the discharge
tube, yet the impression was greater than on any of the papers,
the result being shown in Multiple Sciagraphs, Fig. <a href='#i094a'>1</a>, p. <a href='#Page_94'>94</a>.
He suggested that the plates for use with X-rays should have
unusually thick films. Incidentally he found that the intensifying
process could be employed with profit to bring out the small
details distinctly. Dr. Lodge also recommended thick films.

from the cut which is herewith presented and entitled

concave electrodes in the opposite ends may each be a permanent
cathode, while the upper terminal connected to the angular
sheet of platinum may be the anode. Cathode rays, therefore,
will be sent out from each concave disk, and striking upon the
platinum will be converted into X-rays, assuming that the platinum
is the surface upon which the transformation from one
kind of ray to another takes place. <a href='#E63'>§ 63</a>, at end. This is called

<p class='c013'><a id='E103'></a>103. <span class='sc'>X-Rays. Opalescence and Diffusion.</span> <i>Elect. World</i>,
Apr. 25, ’96.—He alluded to opal glass and milk to illustrate
that light is reflected not only at the surface of a body, but from
points, or molecules, or particles, located underneath the surface.
By some experiments with X-rays, he found that they had a
similar property only not to such a large per cent., but on the
other hand by the way of contrast, there are many more substances
opalescent to X-rays than there are to light, for the reason
that the former will penetrate more substances and to
greater distances. He made many observations with a modified
sciascope, <a href='#E105'>§ 105</a>, by pointing it away from the discharge tube
and towards different substances struck by X-rays. To all appearances,
such substances became the sources of the X-rays.
He alluded to Mr. Tesla’s experiments on reflection, <a href='#E146'>§ 146</a>, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>noticed that there was a slight difference between reflection and
diffusion and he was satisfied that reflection took place from the
interior of the substances as well as from the surface. Metal
plates, he said, gave apparently little diffusive effect, appearing
to reflect feebly at angles equal to the incident angles. He alluded
to Edison’s experiment also, <a href='#E133'>§ 133</a>, with a large thick plate
cutting off the X-rays and attributed the luminosity of his modified
sciascope to rays both reflected and diffused from surrounding
objects, which generally as a matter of course, are more of
non-metallic objects than metallic, such as floor, ceiling, walls,
tables, chairs and so on. Evidently, the interior of one’s hand
causes diffusion; very little, however, for a sciagraph by means
of a focus tube gives wonderfully clear outlines, and yet the rays
do not come from a mathematical point. <a href='#E88'>§ 88</a>. Prof. Thomson
acknowledged that independently of himself, Dr. M. I. Pupin, of
Columbia College, had reported in <i>Science</i>, Apr. 10, ’96, see also
<i>Electricity</i>, Apr. 15, ’96, p. 208, upon investigations on the same
general subject, namely diffusion, and also referred to experiments
of Lenard, <a href='#E69'>§ 69</a>, and Roentgen on diffusion. Agrees also
with experiments of A. Imbert and H. Bertin-Sans in <i>Comptes
Rendus</i>, Mar. 2, ’96. He suggested that this property of diffusion
acted as an explanation why sciagraphs can never have absolutely
clearly cut shadows of the bones or other objects imbedded
in a considerable depth of flesh.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E103a'></a>103<i>a</i>. <span class='sc'>A. Imbert and H. Bertin-Sans’ Diffusion and Reflection
in Relation to Polish. X-Rays.</span> <i>Comptes Rendus</i>,
Mar. 2, ’96. Translated by Louis M. Pignolet.—They concluded,
under the conditions of their experiments, that if X-rays were
capable of reflection it was only in a very small proportion; on
the other hand, the rays can be diffused <i>en assez grande quantité</i>,
the intensity of the diffusion appearing to depend much
more upon the nature of the diffusing body than upon its degree
of polish. From this they attributed to the rays a very small
wave length, such that it would be impossible to get in the degree
of polish necessary to obtain their regular deflection.
Perrin attempted unsuccessfully to reflect the rays from a polished
steel mirror and a plate of “flint,” but with exposures of
one hour and seven hours respectively, nothing was obtained.
From trans. by L. M. Pignolet, <i>Comptes Rendus</i>, Jan., 96. By
exposing a metal plate to the rays and suitably inclining it in
front of the opening, Lafay also proved reflection, for it was
possible to discharge the electrified screen; hence, as he called
it, diffused reflection. <i>Comptes Rendus</i>, Apr. 27, ’96; from trans.
by L. M. Pignolet.</p>
<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span><a id='E104'></a>104. <span class='sc'>Fluorometer.</span>—He constructed an instrument for comparing
the merits of different discharge tubes, and for indicating
the comparative luminosity of different screens subjected
to the action of the same discharge tube. The instrument
served also to act as an indicator of the diffusing power of different
materials. “By placing two exactly similar fluorescent
screens at opposite ends of a dark tube, and employing a Bunsen
photometer screen, movable as usual between the screens, a
comparison of the diffusing power of different materials might
be made by subjecting the pieces placed near the ends of the
photometer tube outside, to equal radiation from the Crookes’
tube.” From Prof. Thomson’s description.</p>

<p class='c008'>The author performed some experiments (<i>Elect. Eng.</i>, N.Y.,
Apr. 15, ’96, p. 379) in relation to candle-power of X-rays by
looking into a sciascope and moving it away until the luminosity
just disappeared. He then detached the black paper cover
from the phosphorescent screen and pointed the sciascope toward
a candle flame and receded away until the fluorescence
also disappeared. The distances, with different candles, would,
of course, somewhat vary, but it would in the rough be a constant
quantity, while different discharge tubes would cause the
vanishing fluorescence at different distances. Now, assuming
that the X-rays vary inversely as the square of the distance,
as believed by Röntgen, their power to fluoresce could, therefore,
always be named as so much of a candle-power.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E105'></a>105. <span class='sc'>Simple Device for Comparing and Locating the
Source and Direction of X-rays. Phosphorescence Not
Essential.</span>—In the ordinary sciascope, the fluorescent screen
is located at one end, and the eyehole at the other. He modified
this construction by employing a long straight tube, made of
thick metal, so that X-rays could not enter through the wall.
About at the centre of the tube was a diaphragm of a fluorescent
material. Now, it is evident that if this is directed toward
the phosphorescent spot and placed very close to the
same, and the other end be looked into, the screen will become
fluorescent, if X-rays are emitted from the area expected. Such
a result occurred. With this instrument, he was able to show, in a
similar way, that X-rays did not come from the anode, nor from
the cathode directly. In one case, he provided a piece of platinum
within the discharge tube, in such a position as to be struck by
the cathode rays. <a href='#E91'>§ § 91</a> and <a href='#E116'>116</a>. The instrument showed that
X-rays radiated from the platinum, although the latter was not
luminous nor phosphorescent,—illustrating again that phosphorescence
is not a necessary accompaniment of X-rays, and assisting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>in upholding the principle that as the phosphorescence
diminishes by increase of vacuum and increase of <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span>, the
X-rays increase. It should be noticed that Prof. Thomson emphasizes
that the tube should be made of thick metal.</p>

always employed the induction coil. As to those who first excited
the discharge tube by the Holtz or Wimshurst machine or
generators of like nature, it is not certain; but, according to
public records, they were independently Prof. M. I. Pupin, of
Columbia College, and Dr. William J. Morton, of New York.
See <i>Electricity</i>, N.Y., Feb. 19, ’96. The accompanying cut
marked “Rice’s Experiment, Fig. <a href='#i100a'>1</a>,” is a diagram representing
the several elements of the apparatus, while “Rice’s Experiment,
Fig. <a href='#i100b'>2</a>,” shows what kind of a sciagraph can be obtained
by means of a Wimshurst machine. <a href='#E101'>§ 101</a>, at centre. The details
of the apparatus as employed by Mr. E. Wilbur Rice, Jr.,
Technical Director of the General Electric Co., were as follows:
A Wimshurst machine, having a glass plate 16 inches diameter,
coupled up with the usual small Leyden jars, spark under best
conditions of atmosphere, etc., 4 inches. “The usual method of
taking pictures with such a machine is to connect the interior
coatings of the two jars, respectively, to the positive and negative
conductors of the machine, the terminals of the discharge
tube being connected between the external coatings of the
Leyden jars. In this condition, the disruptive discharge of the
Leyden jars passes through the tube and across the balls upon
the terminals of the conductors of the machine, the length of
spark being regulated by separating the balls in the usual way.”
Later, he found that by omitting the Leyden jars, the generation
of the X-rays was practically non-intermittent. He therefore
connected the terminals of the discharge tube directly to
those of the Wimshurst machine as indicated in “Rice’s Experiment,
Fig. <a href='#i100a'>1</a>,” which also illustrates the details in the carrying
out of the experiment for obtaining the picture, Fig. <a href='#i100b'>2</a>, of
the purse containing the coins and a key. The principal feature
was the introduction of a lead diaphragm containing a small
central opening 7-8 inch diameter opposite the fluorescent spot.
Sciagraphs taken thus required a little more time, about 60 minutes,
while without the diaphragm, the time could be shortened
to about 30 minutes, but the shadows were not so clear in the
latter case. The figures are on p. <a href='#Page_100'>100</a>.</p>

rapidly upon receding from the diaphragm. If the rays had
come from the cathode, however, the fluorescent spot on the

and, therefore, the rays must have come from the spot on
the glass struck by the cathode rays. <a href='#E113'>§ 113</a>, <a href='#E116'>116</a>, <a href='#E117'>117</a>.</p>

Experiment. X-Rays From Two Phosphorescent Spots.</span>
<i>Elect. World</i>, Mar. 14, ’96.—By means of nails projecting vertically
from a board (similar to the process carried out by Dr.
William J. Morton, <i>Elect. Eng.</i>, N.Y., Mar. 5, ’96), they
proved, undoubtedly, that the source of the X-rays was at the
surface of the glass directly opposite the cathode. By modification,
which acted as further proof, a tube was provided with a
cathode at the centre. There was a phosphorescent spot at
each end. One board was placed laterally to the tube, and two
shadows of each of certain nails were cast, which were caused
as proved by measurement, by a double source of X-rays. This
experiment illustrates the importance of preventing double
shadows. The plate should be perpendicular to the line joining
the two sources of the X-rays when there are two such sources.
Even with the focus tube Dr. Philip M. Jones, of San Francisco,
determined that there were two phosphorescent spots. These
should be taken into account in all cases and attempts made to

pp. 392, 393.—Prof. Stine, of the <i>Armour. Inst. of Tech.</i>, by
means of the diagram shown in Fig. <a href='#i102a'>1</a>, p. <a href='#Page_102'>102</a>, clearly proved that
the X-rays have their source at the area struck by the cathode
rays located directly opposite the disk marked “cathode.” If
the reader will investigate the diagram and the sciagraphs, he
will obtain a clearer knowledge of the evidence than by any
verbal description, further than to explain how the elements
are related to one another. In Fig. <a href='#i102a'>1</a>, therefore, will be noticed
covered photographic plates, located as indicated with reference
to the extreme left-hand end of the discharge tube, where the
cathode rays strike. The surface of Plate 5 is parallel to that
of the cathode, and the phosphorescent spot is in line between
the two above named elements. The result is shown in Fig. <a href='#i102b'>2</a>,
p. <a href='#Page_102'>102</a>, the objects sciagraphed being several short sections of
tubes with diameters varying from 1/2 to 3 inches.</p>

The sciagraph in Fig. <a href='#i104a'>3</a> was obtained on
the plate shown at the top in Fig. <a href='#i102a'>1</a>; that in Fig. <a href='#i104b'>4</a>, on Plate 2;
that in Fig. 5, on Plate 3; and that in Fig. 6, on Plate 4. Not
only were direct shadows visible, but also secondary shadows,
indicating, therefore, that, although the source of practically all
the rays was at the phosphorescent spot, yet a portion of the
rays came slightly from other directions, either by reflection or
by actual production of rays, upon other portions of the tube.
Look now especially at Fig. <a href='#i104a'>3</a>, p. <a href='#Page_104'>104</a>. If the rays came from
the anode, then would this appearance necessarily be the same
as that in Fig. <a href='#i102b'>2</a>. Similarly, the other sciagraphs may be considered
to show that the rays do not come from the anode. In
the case of the sciagraphs in Figs. <a href='#i104b'>4</a>, <a href='#i112left'>5</a> and <a href='#i112right'>6</a>,
only a single tube
acted as the body for casting a shadow. Prof. Stine stated that
the experiments were repeated over and over again, thereby establishing
the phenomena as uniform.</p>

<p class='c013'>The small interrupter was found the more reliable, and seemed to shorten the needed time of exposure. A rotary contact-maker,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>giving two interruptions of the current per revolution,
was also tested. This was driven by a motor with a condenser
capacity of fourteen microfarads connected across the
brushes. Owing to the large capacity of the condenser, a heavy
current could be broken without marked sparking. The circuit
breaker was tested at speeds ranging from 500 to 4,000 per
minute, to note the influence on the time of exposure. The
best results were obtained at the lower speed.... As no
especial advantage could be noted when using the mercury
breaker, it was abandoned for the vibrating interrupter.” This
point is noted in detail, since so many experimenters seem to
prefer such cumbersome devices, but they are, in reality, unnecessary.</p>

Penumbral Shadows.</span> <i>Elec. Eng.</i>, Apr. 22, ’96, p. 408.—By
referring to the diagram marked “Stine’s Experiment, Fig. <a href='#i105'>A</a>,”
the arrangement of the elements may be seen, while the photographic
print is shown in “Stine’s Experiment, Fig. <a href='#i106'>B</a>.” p. 106.
Prof. Stine described the investigation as follows: Diffraction
is naturally one of the first kinematical points to be investigated
in the Roentgen experiments. It was noticed that when the
opaque object was some distance from the plate, pronounced
penumbral shadows resulted. These were of such width as to
indicate diffraction. However, when such shadows are plotted
back to the tube they are found to be purely penumbral, and not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>caused by diffraction. To completely demonstrate this point
the experiment illustrated in Fig. A was undertaken. Here A<sub>1</sub>
to A<sub>4</sub> are brass plates one inch wide and 1/8 inch thick, and of the
length of the dry plate employed. They were first fastened together,
so as to leave two parallel slots 1/8 of an inch wide.
These plates are placed within 3/8 of an inch of the bulb, were
one inch apart, and rested 1-1/8 inches above the dry plate. The
resulting sciagraph is shown in Fig. <a href='#i106'>B</a>. In the diagram S<sub>1</sub> S<sub>2</sub>,
the edges of the penumbral shadow are very sharp and distinct.
The direction of the rays is indicated, showing that there was
absolutely no diffraction. This experiment has been modified
in a variety of tests, with always the same result.”</p>

now solely to Fig. <a href='#i107'>1</a>, S. and M.’s experiment. Notice the relative

with the cathode at the upper part and the phosphorescent spot
opposite thereto; then below a thick lead plate with a single
opening; then a second lead plate with two small openings
placed laterally at such a distance that if there were rectilinear
rays from the cathode they could not strike (by passing through
the small hole), the covered photographic plate which was the
next element in order. The description did not state that the
photographic plate was covered, but the experimenters must
have had the usual opaque cover upon it or else the luminous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>rays could have produced images. The developed plate showed
two spots strongly acted upon and surrounded by portions which
were less acted upon, the same as would be produced by light
radiating from a surface as distinguished from a point. From
the fact that they stated that the exposures were very long, it
may be concluded also that the plates were covered by a material
opaque to ordinary light. Measurement showed that the
rays which produced the images came from the phosphorescent
spot (<a href='#E106'>§ 106</a>, <a href='#E109'>109</a>, <a href='#E114'>114</a>, <a href='#E131'>131</a>, <a href='#E139'>139</a>) and not from the cathode directly

by Pin-Hole Images.</span> Reference may now be made
to S. and M.’s Experiment, Fig. <a href='#i107'>2</a>.—The discharge tube has, as
before, a cathode on one side, and the phosphorescent spot during
operation on the opposite side. Lead plates were provided
in positions indicated by the heavy black straight lines, there
being a pin hole in each one. Behind these lead plates, measured
from the discharge tube, were the covered photographic
plates, as indicated. By measurement, it was afterwards determined
that practically all the X-rays started from the phosphorescent
spot. The electrode was put in an oblique position, as
indicated, so that the same would not obstruct any X-rays trying
to pass through the pin hole in the uppermost plate. The
experiment served specifically to show that the X-rays started
from the inner surface of the glass, because images produced
on the upper and lower plates were equally strong. Perrin also
found that the X-rays are developed at the interior sides of the
tubes. (<i>Comptes Rendus</i>, Mar. 23, ’96. From trans. by L. M. P.)
The rays, in producing each image, had to pass through an equal
thickness of glass. If the rays had come from the outer surface,
for example, two thicknesses would have been traversed
by the rays striking the upper plate, and no thickness by those
impinging upon the lower plate. That no rays came from any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>other portion or element of the discharge tube was evident,
because a picture of the phosphorescent spot was the only one
produced, and this picture was inverted, as usual, with pin
hole cameras. (A pin-hole camera is the same as any other, with
the lens replaced by a very small hole, which acts as a lens.)</p>

<p class='c008'>In the way of further evidence, if not enough already, Meslans
early determined that the phosphorescent spot on the glass
is the source of X-rays (<i>Comptes Rendus</i>, Feb. 24, ’96. From

<p class='c008'>As both Thomson (E.) and Rowland, as well as De Heen, at

Pin-Hole Pictures by X-rays to Determine Source of
X-rays, and Pin-Hole Images upon Glass Compared.</span> <i>The
Elect.</i>, Lon. Apr. 10, ’96, p. 784.—The object of the experiment
was to confirm, if possible, by a modified construction, the
source of the X-rays, as being the surface struck by cathode
rays, whether the surface is that of glass or any other substance.
He had constructed, for this purpose, a discharge tube,
as illustrated in the diagram, which may be seen, at a glance,
to contain a concave electrode at one
end, and a flat electrode at the other.
Between them, and connected to the
concave electrode, is an inclined sheet
of aluminum, shading both electrodes.
The wires leading to the aluminum
sheet are well protected by glass.
He arranged matters so that either the concave or the flat electrode
could be made positive or negative. The operation consisted
first in taking through a pin hole, 1/4 of an inch in
diameter, X-ray pictures on photographic plates, from different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>points, at measured distances. After these were taken, glass
plates received the luminous images at the positions of the
sensitive plate. Pencil drawings were then made, and compared
with the X-ray pictures. The experiment involved also
the repetition of this operation, except that the polarity of the
terminals was changed.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When the small flat disk was cathode, every part of the
complicated anode appeared strongly and quickly on the plate,
especially the tilted and first bombarded portion on a photographic
plate placed above the tube. The cathode disk itself
did not show at all. On a plate placed below the bulb, the
anode cup appeared strong, but the tilted disk did not appear.
On the other hand, … its focus spot acted as a feeble
point source, by reason of a few rays reflected back on to it
from the cup.</p>

<p class='c008'>“When the current was <i>reversed</i>, the small disk anode showed
faintly, being excited by rays which had penetrated the interposed
tilted disk, but again the cathode hardly showed at all,
not even the tilted portion on a plate placed below the bulb.
This is confirmed by J. Perrin. In no case could an image of
the cathode be obtained. (<i>Comptes Rendus</i>) Mar. 23, ’96. From
trans. by L. M. P.) By giving a very long exposure (two hours),
some impression was obtained by Dr. Lodge about equal to
that from the shaded anode disk; but, of course, if the tilted
plate had been under these circumstances an anode, it is well
known that a few minutes would have sufficed to show it strong
upon the plate beneath.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Hence, undoubtedly, the X-rays do not start from the cathode
<i>or from anything attached to the cathode</i> but do start from a surface
upon which the cathode rays strike, whether it be an actual
anode or only an ‘anti-cathodic’ surface. Best, however, if it be
an actual anode. (Independently discovered by Rowland, <a href='#E116'>§ 116</a>.
and Roentgen, <a href='#E91'>§ 91</a>.”)</p>

<p class='c008'>“When the glass walls, instead of receiving cathode rays, are
pierced only by the true Roentgen rays from the disk in the
middle, no evidence is afforded by my photograph that the
glass under these circumstances acts as a source. It is well that
it does not, for its only effect would be a blurring one. <a href='#E91'>§ 91</a>.
With focus tubes, the glass phosphoresces under the action of
the X-rays as anything else would phosphoresce, but its phosphorescence
is not of the least use. It is a sign that a tube is
working well, and that the rays are powerful; but if by reason
of fatigue (<a href='#E58'>§ 58</a>) the glass ceases to phosphoresce strongly, the
fact constitutes not the slightest detriment.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>X-Ray Uninfluenced by a Magnet. Severe Test.</span>—His
first experiment on magnetic deflection, the sciagraph of a magnet
with a background of wire gauze, only showed that if there
were any shift by reason of passage of rays between the poles it
was very small; but he definitely asserted, as in accompanying
diagram, that a further experiment has been made which effectually
removes the idea of deflectibility from his mind, and confirms
the statement of Professor Roentgen. <a href='#E79'>§ 79</a>. A strong
though small electro-magnet, with concentrated field, had a photograph
of its pole-pieces taken with a couple of wires, A and C,
stretched across them on the further side from the plate—nearer
the source—and a third wire, B, also stretched across them, but
on the side close to the plate. These three wires left shadows
on the plate, of which B was sharp and definite, while A and C
were blurred. Two sciagraphs were taken by Mr. Robinson,
one with the magnet on, and one with the magnet reversed. On
subsequently superposing the two plates, with the sharp shadows
of B coincident, the very slightest displacement of shadows
A and C could have been observed, although those shadows
were not sharp. But there was absolutely no perceptible displacement,
the fit was perfect. Consequently the hypothesis of
a stream of electrified particles is definitely disproved as no
doubt had already been effectively done in reality by Professor
Roentgen himself. But it must be noted, he stated, that the
hypothesis of a simple molecular stream—not an electrified one—remains
a possibility. The only question is whether such an
unelectrified bombardment would be able to produce the observed
effects. It must be remembered, Dr. Lodge stated, that
Dr. Lenard found among his rays two classes as regards deflectibility—some
much deflected, others less deflected; and it must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>be clearly understood that his deflections were observed, not in
the originating discharge tube, where the fact of deflection is a
commonplace, but outside, after the rays had been, as it were,
“filtered” through an aluminum window. He did not, indeed,
observe the deflection in air of ordinary density; it was in moderately
rarefied air that he observed it, <a href='#E72a'>§ 72<i>a</i></a>, but he showed that
the variation of air density did not affect the amount, but only
the clearness of the minimum magnetic deflection. The circumstance
that affected the amount of the deflection was a variation
in the contents of the originating or high-vacuum tube.</p>

Lon., April 10, ’96, p. 783.—With his apparatus, he was able to
obtain rays sufficiently powerful to illuminate the usual fluorescent
screen after passing through one’s skull. It is of interest
to note about the details of the electrical apparatus (<a href='#E106'>§ § 106</a>,
<a href='#E109'>109</a>, <a href='#E131'>131</a>, <a href='#E137'>137</a>) used by those who experimented. The best results
were obtained by a make and break of a direct primary current at
a point under alcohol, the primary battery consisting of three storage
cells, and the current of the primary acting on a large secondary
coil. Leyden jars he considered entirely unnecessary, and
he preferred direct currents to alternating currents for the primary.
He did not give the exact dimensions of the primary and
secondary coils, but, judging from reports of others and the author’s
own experience, it is highly preferable to have what is
called a very large inductorium, 15 in. spark in open air, or
else the Tesla system (<a href='#E51'>§ § 51</a>, <a href='#E137'>137</a>). There is little satisfaction in
trying to perform the experiments with induction coils adapted
to give only a 2 or 3 in. spark in open air.</p>

10, ’96.—In order to explain in what way the rays were propagated,
he says that it is not as if the glass surface were a wave
front from every point of which rays proceed normally, but
that the glass radiates X-rays just as a red-hot surface radiates
light, namely, a cone of rays starts from each point, and all the
rays of each cone start in a different direction. Every point
of the glass radiates the rays independently of all other
points. Crookes’ Experiment (<a href='#E58'>§ 58</a>) may now be called to
mind in reference to the fatiguing of the glass after phosphorescing
for a while. Lodge tested the fatiguing as to the power
to emit X-rays, but found that there was no such property

led the above named investigators to think at first that the
source of the X-rays was at the anode. <i>Amer. Jour. Sci.</i>, March,
’96. Prof. Elihu Thomson was led to give the same opinion
during his first experiments. <i>Elect. Rev.</i>, N.Y., Mar. 25, ’96.
See also <a href='#E112a'>§ 112<i>a</i></a>. Many other experiments certify to the allegation
that X-rays are certainly generated at the phosphorescent
spot on the glass. <a href='#E79'>§ 79</a>, <a href='#E105'>105</a>, <a href='#E107'>107</a>, <a href='#E108'>108</a>, <a href='#E111'>111</a>,
<a href='#E112'>112</a>, <a href='#E113'>113</a>. From the
experiments of Prof. Rowland, <i>et al.</i>, the confusion is accounted
for by the fact that they overlooked the electrical condition of
the spot struck by the cathode rays. Prof. Rowland, <i>et al.</i>, constructed
a tube having a platinum sheet located at the focus of
the concave electrode, and <i>not</i> connected to the anode. Although
the platinum became red hot, it emitted no X-rays, but
when the platinum was made the anode, there was profuse radiation
of X-rays in all directions from that side of the platinum
struck by the cathode rays, and no radiation from the other side.
<a href='#E91'>§ 91</a>. (See also Roentgen and Tesla, concerning 1/2 platinum
and 1/2 aluminum and radiation therefrom.) They inferred as a
final conclusion in connection with this point, “That the necessary
condition for the production of X-rays is an anode bombardment
by the cathode discharge.” <a href='#E113'>§ 113</a>. They recognized
apparently that it had been conclusively proved that X-rays radiated
from the phosphorescent spot on the glass. They held
that such a spot is “The induced anode formed on the glass.”
<a href='#E49'>§ 49</a>, at end. They did not prove this by an experiment according
to the article referred to, but based it upon “The fact that
the bombarding cathode rays coming in periodical electrified
showers alternately raise and lower the potential of the glass,
thus making it alternately an anode and a cathode. In the case
of the platinum, this could not occur to the same extent.”</p>

Prof. Salvioni in <i>Elect. Rev.</i>, N.Y., Apr. 8, ’96, p. 181.—In order
to change the location of the phosphorescent spot when desired,
without a magnet, and at the same time to concentrate or intensify
the source of X-rays, he placed near the same, on the outside
of the tube, the hand or a metal mass connected to earth.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>The spot immediately jumped to the other side of the tube, <a href='#E49'>§ 49</a>,
near centre, and to all appearances was smaller and brighter.
Elster and Geitel had performed similar experiments at an
earlier date. (See <i>Wied. Ann.</i>, LVI., 12, p. 733, also <i>Elect. Eng.</i>,
about April, ’96.) They carried on the most minute investigations
as to the deflection of the cathode rays by an outside
conductor. Tesla had also noticed a similar deviation. See
Martin’s <i>Tesla’s Researches</i>. He used alternating currents as
described in his system in <a href='#E51'>§ 51</a>. Elster and Geitel used the
Tuma Alternating system. (See <i>Wied. Ann.</i>, Ber. 102, part 2<span class='fss'>A</span>,
p. 1352, ’94.) The source from which Salvioni’s description was
taken had no sketch, therefore the diagram made by Elster and
Geitel is reproduced. See Fig. <a href='#i114'>1</a>. The cathode was aluminum
and was connected to one terminal of the transformer. The
anode was connected to earth, and also was the other terminal.
Upon bringing the hand or other conductor connected to earth
to the phosphorescent spot, the cathode rays deviated and the
spot jumped over to the other side. <a href='#E50'>§ 50</a>. The anode was a
ring surrounding the leading-in wires of the cathode, and the
two leading-in wires were surrounded by glass. It may be
asked why the cathode rays bent downward in the first place?
Elster and Geitel found that they were thrown thus in view of
the nearness of some neighboring object connected to earth.
To overcome the action of surrounding objects, the tube was
surrounded by a ring as shown in Fig. <a href='#i114'>2</a>. However, the rays
were still sensitive to objects well connected to earth, and when
brought quite close to the tube.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='E117a'></a>117<i>a</i>. <span class='sc'>Hammer and Fleming’s Molecular Sciagraph, within
a Vacuum Tube.</span> (<i>Citations below.</i>)—In view of the overwhelming
evidence concerning the generation of X-rays by the impact
of cathode rays, within a high vacuum upon the glass or
material which preferably forms the anode, it becomes appropriate,
it is thought, to review the state of this department of
science, in order to arrive a little more closely at the relations
which exist between phenomena of low and high vacua. With
the former, in that condition in which striae are formed, permanent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>black bands or deposits are produced upon the surface of
the glass; the motion of the particles, therefore, appearing to
be in planes at right angles to the line joining the anode and cathode.
<a href='#E40'>§ 40</a>. That the striae should touch the walls of the tube
seems to be necessary for the production of the deposit. <a href='#E44'>§ 44</a>.
With a high vacuum, the direction of the cathode rays
may be any that one desires, it being only necessary to shape
the cathode properly, on the principle that the rays radiate
normally from the surface. It is known that the radiation is
normal as much from the position of the deposit as from that
of the phosphorescent spot. It is certain that they are rectilinear.
<a href='#E57'>§ § 57</a> and <a href='#E58'>58</a>. The phosphorescent spot becomes always, sooner
or later, when occurring upon the same part of the glass, the
location of a deposit from the cathode (<a href='#E123'>§ 123</a>), even when
the cathode is aluminum. <a href='#E123'>§ 123</a>. The deposit is not the cause
of the fatigue of the glass. <a href='#E58'>§ 58</a>. Puluj verified this. A
wheel was made to rotate by the radiations from the cathode,
and therefore it is highly probable that the motion of the molecules,
which caused the deposit, is the force that made the
wheel rotate. <a href='#E58a'>§ 58<i>a</i></a>. Why does it not follow that with increase
of <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> the particles are thrown with such rapidity that upon
striking the proper surface (<a href='#E80'>§ 80</a>), X-rays are generated, but
that they are not generated when the velocity of the molecules
is insufficient. <a href='#E61b1'>§ 61<i>b</i></a>, p. <a href='#Page_46'>46</a>. Attention is now invited to a phenomenon
which illustrates that a permanent sciagraph of objects
may be impressed upon the inner surface of a vacuum
tube, by the deposit of molecules of one of the electrodes.
Refer, therefore, to the figure on page <a href='#Page_30'>30</a>, “Hammer and
Fleming’s Molecular Sciagraph.” As will be seen from further
explanation and from the picture itself, the sciagraph <i>a b</i> is
made because of the projection, in rectilinear lines, of molecules
of carbon or metal, from one of the electrodes, or at
least from one more than the other. One leg of the carbon, being
in the way of the other, causes a less deposit to be produced
upon the glass at the intersection of the plane of the horse-shoe
filament and the wall of the vacuum tube. Electrodes
exist because the filament is of such a high resistance as to
produce a difference of potential between the two straight
lower portions of the filament. Mr. William J. Hammer possesses
a remarkable faculty for observing phenomena often
overlooked by others. He first observed a molecular shadow
in 1880 and made records of his observations in the Edison
Laboratory note book. Since that time he has examined over
600 lamps, which were made at various periods during thirteen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>or fourteen years, by twelve different manufacturers. (<i>Trans.
Amer. Inst. Electrical Eng.</i>, Mar. 21, p. 161.) Every one, more
or less, exhibited the molecular shadow. It is a principle,
therefore, that if the carbon filament has both legs in the same
plane, a sciagraph of one of them will be produced. As the
shadow is on one side of the bulb only, the molecules fly off
from only one electrode, viz., the cathode. By means of
photography, the effect is increased because of certain well-known
principles. The figure heretofore referred to is taken
from a photograph, but, of course, does not represent the sciagraph
as well as the original photograph, in view of the loss
of effect by re-production by the half-tone process. For further
theoretical considerations, see the Institute paper referred to,
where the matter was discussed by Profs. Elihu Thomson,
Anthony and others. Independently of Mr. Hammer’s discovery,
Prof. J. A. Fleming, professor of electrical engineering in the
University College, London, England, discovered and studied
the matter, and presented it before the <i>Phys. Soc.</i> of London,
appearing about 1885 (<i>from memory</i>). The name “molecular
sciagraph” is given by the author because it is an accepted explanation
that the deposit is due to either molecules or atoms of
the electrode, given off by evaporation (page <a href='#Page_46'>46</a>, lines 5 to 10),
or electrical repulsion (<a href='#E61a'>§ 61<i>a</i></a>, lines 22 to 25), or, as some hold,
by mere volatilization by the intense heat of incandescence, or
one or more combined; but electrical repulsion certainly has
something to do with the rectilinear propagation, for the molecules
are charged according to <a href='#E4'>§ 4</a>.</p>

high vacua. <a href='#E54'>§ 54</a>. In carrying the vacuum up higher and
higher, Edison observed that feeble Roentgen rays were detected
before the striae ceased. Prof. Elihu Thomson independently
performed a like experiment and found that the Roentgen
rays could be obtained even when the vacuum was so low as to
produce striae. (<i>Elec. Eng.</i>, N.Y., Apr. 15, ’96.) Victor Chabaud
and D. Hurmuzescu also obtained X-rays from a vacuum .025

X-Rays and Post-Phosphorescence.</span>—This may be understood
by explanation of the discharge tube in Fig. <a href='#i118'>1</a>. In one experiment,
the portion struck by the cathode rays, namely B, was
made 1/8 inch thick. It became soon hot and very luminous and
melted, <a href='#E61'>§ 61</a>, but the X-rays were weak. When blown thin,
(<a href='#E83'>§ 83</a>) however, the glass remained cool and the X-rays were
much stronger. What is known on the market as German glass
(phosphoresces green, <a href='#E55'>§ 55</a>, at centre) was found more permeable
than lead glass, the thickness of the walls being the same in
both cases. There were no lingering X-rays from after-phosphorescence,
(<a href='#E54'>§ 54</a>, at end) or, if any, could not be detected by
the sciascope. The photographic test would be objectionable
because of the brief duration. Prof. Battelli and Dr. Garbasso,
of Pisa, made a very <i>sensitive</i> test in this connection, proving by
the discharge of an electrified body (<a href='#E90'>§ § 90</a> and <a href='#E90a'>90<i>a</i></a>) that feeble
X-rays were emitted after the current was cut off from the discharge
tube. (From trans. by Mr. Pignolet.)</p>

of the length to the diameter. The shaded ends represent
tinfoil on the outside and connecting with the leading-in wires,
the same preventing puncture of the glass by the spark. They

Pupin was among the first to test the efficiency of external
electrodes for generating X-rays. Independently of the
quality of the glass and of the kind of pump and of the presence
or absence of phosphoric anhydride, the following peculiarities
were noticed, which Edison attributed to a kind of atomic
electrolysis. <a href='#E47'>§ 47</a>. 80 per cent. of the lamps exhibited the
phenomena as follows: First, such a high vacuum was obtained
by the pump that the line spectrum disappeared and pure fluorescence
and generation of X-rays at a maximum occurred.
The lamp was then sealed off. After three or four hours of
rest, the vacuum deteriorated, so that striae and other characteristics
of low vacuum were obtained when connected up in
circuit, but upon continuing the current, the high vacuum gradually
came back, the line spectrum vanished, and suddenly
X-rays were generated. Again the bulb was left at rest for
24 hours, after which X-rays could not be generated until the
discharge had been continued for 4-1/2 hours.</p>

Then he made the vacuum so high that even with a 12-inch
spark from Leyden jars, no discharge took place with external
electrodes, and the tube was dark, this part of the experiment
indicating another limit at which an extremely high vacuum is
not a conductor and appearing to overthrow, as Edison intimated,

has always been common to employ aluminum for electrodes in
vacuum tubes, on the ground that no deposit took place, and
therefore no blackening, nor whitening of the glass wall. <a href='#E40'>§ 40</a>.
Edison observed also that no blackening was visible, but stated
that his glass blower, Mr. Dally, upon breaking the bulb and
submitting the interior surface of the glass to an oxydizing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>process, the oxide of aluminum was so thick as to be opaque to
light. With magnesium, also, a mirror was produced, of a
lavender color, by transmitted light. In the case of aluminum,
he was able to obtain a visible spot at the phosphorescent portion,
but only after a great many hours of use. See cut from a
photograph of a discharge tube used for several months by
Prof. Dayton C. Miller, and having a heavy aluminum deposit
opposite the aluminum cathode. With the increase of the
deposit, the power of the X-rays diminished, but, he thought,
not on account of the absorption, but because, “through lack of
elasticity at the surface.”</p>

the electrodes are covered with fluorescent or phosphorescent
substances, intended for the purpose of obtaining greater candle
power by impact of cathode rays upon anode of platinum,
covered with alumina or magnesia. Edison coated the inner
wall of the discharge tube, for generating X-rays, with calcic
tungstate in the crystalline form. The luminosity, when measured,
amounted to about 2-1/2 <span class='fss'>C. P.</span> As to the efficiency, he
stated that this was accomplished “with an extremely small
amount of energy.” Such a coating was found to weaken the
X-rays radiated therefrom, which, of course, was natural, because
they had been converted into phosphorescent light. The
spectrum showed strongly at the red line, thereby suggesting
the reason why the light was of a pleasant character.</p>

by a tube containing an easily fluorescent substance. <i>Comptes

As the X-rays emanate from the fluorescent spots on the glass
of the discharge tube, he reasoned that more powerful effects
would be obtained by replacing the glass by a more fluorescent
material. He therefore tried a Puluj tube and found that it
shortened the time necessary for taking a photograph in a
“singular” degree. Experiments of others have certainly shown
that as phosphorescence decreases with increase of vacuum, the
X-rays increase to a certain maximum, <a href='#E105'>§ 105</a>. Let it be noticed
however, that this does not prove that with the same vacuum,
an increase of phosphorescence by a superior phosphorescent
material of equal thickness would not increase the power of the
X-rays. The best way to determine such points, is to go to extremes.
Edison applied so much easily phosphorescent material
(calcic tungstate) to the inside of the discharge tube, that much
light was radiated, but only feeble X-rays. On the other hand,
without any of the tungstate, the rays were strong, <a href='#E124'>§ 124</a>. Experiments
generally tend to prove that it depends upon the
chemical nature of the material rather than its phosphorescing
power, in other words upon the permeability. <a href='#E119'>§ 119</a>, near end.</p>

Edison called attention to Tesla’s discovery that this substance
is a good conductor for high tension currents. Its advantages
for electrodes in the discharge tube are its high conductivity, no
absorbed nor released gas bubbles, and its infusibility and non-blackening
power of glass even when the voltage was increased
to a point where the glass melted.</p>

the generation of the X-rays the sodium line of the spectrum
appeared in the spectroscope, thereby indicating decomposition
of the glass. With combustion tubes the glass gave the weakest
soda line, while lime soda glass gave the strongest, and was most
permeable to the X-rays. “The continuous decomposition of the
glass makes it almost impossible to maintain a vacuum except
when connected to the pump and even then the effect of the
current is greater in producing gas than the capacity of the
pump to exhaust, but the ray is very powerful.” It is supposed
that for this reason, as well as for others easily apparent that
Edison as well as other experimenters have always carried on
their investigations with the discharge tube permanently connected
to the pump. The next best thing is to let the tube contain
a stick of caustic potash for maintaining an exceedingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>high vacuum. By gradually heating this, the desired degree of
vacuum can be obtained. <a href='#E54'>§ 54</a>.</p>

at a distance of 3/8 inch from the phosphorescent spot in
one second, a vulcanized cover being between; at two ft. distant
the time was 150 sec.; at three ft., 450 sec.; the opaque
plate being interposed each time. Consequently “Roughly, the
duration of exposure may be reckoned as proportional to the

The rapid plate for light gave not the deepest images by X-rays.
Several different kinds of small sensitive plates were laid side
by side. A sciagraph of a metal bar was taken upon them all
simultaneously. In this way, he obtained the result, whereby
it would appear preferable to employ the mean rapid plate for
the purpose of obtaining sciagraphs. On account of the opacity
of platinum, it occured to E. B. Frost, (<i>Sci.</i>, N.Y., Mar. 27, ’96,)
to try platinum photographic paper of the kind used for portraits,
but such paper (intended for long exposures in printing in sunlight)
was far too lacking in sensitiveness to produce any effect.</p>

in using a permanent or electro-magnet to create a magnetic
field perpendicular to the cathode rays in the tube. By
this means, the active fluorescent spot on the tube is condensed,
and the intensity of the X-rays generated there is increased.
Another advantage is that, when the active part of the tube becomes
inactive owing to the formation of a light brown deposit
upon it, another part can be used by very slightly altering the
position of the magnets. Thus, each time a new part of the tube
can be used. The magnetic field must not be uniform but must
have a suitable variation to produce the desired concentration
of the cathode rays.</p>

<p class='c008'>Prof. Trowbridge, of Harvard University, in a lecture, gave
an interesting review (<i>Western Elect.</i>, Feb. 29, ’96) of the length
of time required in the early days of photography. Improvements
are being made whereby the duration required in sciagraphy
becomes less and less. In 1827, by heliography, 6 hours’
exposure was necessary; in 1839, by daguerreotype, 30 minutes;
in 1841, by calotype, 3 minutes; in 1851, by collodion, 10 seconds;
in 1864, by collodion, 5 seconds; in 1878, by gelatine, 1 second.
The author remembers the photographs for use in the Edison
kinetoscope were taken at the rate of 20 per second. The focus
tube brings the time of exposure in behalf of X-rays down to
a matter of seconds instead of minutes. For an admirable review
of authorities, facts and theories relating to the causes of

centre, and in two or three seconds made the glass red hot at
the centre of the phosphorescent spot. Immediately, the atmospheric
pressure perforated the bulb. This occurred several
times. He stated that “the best remedy is to permit the central
ray to strike the glass at a low angle; this greatly increases
the area and prevents the trouble.” <span class='sc'>Edison.</span></p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Ludwig Gutmann furnished a translation of a note by
Prof. Walter König, found in <i>Eleck. Zeit.</i> of May 14, ’96, relating
to this same subject matter. Recognizing that the sharpness
of the outlines is the most important requirement in connection
with sciagraphy, and that if the rays start from a large
surface the impressed shadows will be uncertain in configuration,
and noticing, as Edison and Tesla did, <a href='#E130'>§ 130</a>, the frequent
destruction of the tube at the place where the rays were concentrated
to a focus, he placed over the inner surface of the glass,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>aluminum foil for distributing the heat over a larger area, at
the same time causing radiation of X-rays from a single point.
The focus tube outweighs this in importance. <a href='#E91'>§ 91</a>.</p>

usual incandescent-lamp current, voltage at 110 to 120 volts, current being
continuous, but not connected directly to the induction coil,
there being a bank of eight to twenty 16 candle power incandescent
lamps arranged in parallel. The interrupter for the
primary consisted of a rotating wheel in appearance like a commutator
of a dynamo, and was rotated rapidly by a small electric
motor, making about 400 interruptions per second, and so constructed
that the circuit was closed twice as long as it was open.
A sudden interruption was caused by an air blast playing at the
point of make and break, the use of which made that of a condenser
needless. <a href='#E3'>§ 3</a>. The discharge tube terminals were connected
respectively and directly to those of the secondary.
Prof. Pupin, Columbia Univ. N.Y. (<i>Lect. N.Y., Acad. Sci.</i>,
April 6, ’96, and <i>Science</i>, N.Y., April 10, ’96) gave valuable and
practical instruction concerning the apparatus, which the author
witnessed. “A powerful coil was found indispensable for strong
effects and satisfactory work. The vibrating interrupter is too
slow and otherwise unsatisfactory, and it was replaced by a rotary
interrupter, consisting of a brass pulley, 6 inches in diameter
and 1-1/4 inches in thickness. A slab of slate 3/4 inch thick was
inserted and the circumference was kept carefully polished.
This pulley was mounted on the shaft of a Crocker-Wheeler 1/8
<span class='fss'>H. P.</span> motor giving 30 revolutions, and, therefore, 60 breaks per
second. Two adjustable Marshall condensers of three microfarads
each were connected in shunt with the break, and the
capacity adjusted carefully until the break-spark was a minimum
and gave a sharp cracking sound. Too much capacity
will not necessarily increase the sparking, but it will diminish
the inductive effect which is noticed immediately in the diminished
intensity of the discharge. A powerful coil with a smoothly
working rotary interrupter will be found a most satisfactory
apparatus in experiments with Röntgen radiance.” <a href='#E106'>§ 106</a>, <a href='#E109'>109</a>,

N.Y., April 19, ’96, p. 165. Edison examined over 1800 chemicals
to detect and compare their fluorescent powers if any, under
the action of X-rays first transmitted through some opaque
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>material such as thick cardboard. Of all these, calcic tungstate
by measurement, fluoresced with six times the luminosity of
barium platino cyanide, which was referred to in connection
with Roentgen’s experiment. Other authorities agree as to its
great sensitiveness. In making this comparison, it was assumed
that the power of the X-rays varied inversely as the square of
the distance from the discharge tube. Between the two above
chemicals came strontic tungstate. Baric and plumbic tungstate
scarcely fluoresced. Salicylate of ammonium crystals equalled
the double cyanide of platinum and barium, and differed therefrom
in that the fluorescence increased with the thickness of the
layer of crystals up to 1/4 of an inch, showing great fluorescing
power and low absorptivity. This experiment showed that the
best fluorescent materials were not necessarily the salts of the
heaviest metals, like platinum. It is assumed that the reader
knows the difference between phosphorescence and fluorescence,
but the dividing line is so difficult in some cases and the one
not being distinguished from the other by experimenters, that
the author has used the same words as the experimenters,
although he admits that fluorescence is often meant where
phosphorescence is stated, and <i>vice versa</i>. An anomaly presented
itself as to rock salt, which although transparent to light yet
powerfully absorbed X-rays and was strongly fluoresced thereby.
Again, fluorite which is transparent to light, fluoresced strongly
with the X-rays, and under their action became brighter and
brighter and continued after cutting off the X-rays, the material
therefore, being highly phosphorescent, the light enduring for
several minutes. Upon watching the phosphorescence of fluorite,
the same penetrated the plate very slowly to the depth of
one-sixteenth of an inch, but beyond that depth there was complete
darkness. The only other truly phosphorescent substance
noticed was calcic tungstate, especially in thick layers, so that
the shadow of the bones of the hand remained thereon for a
minute or two upon cutting out the discharge tube from the
circuit. Some chemicals, within a dark box and <i>very close</i> to the
discharge tube, phosphoresced by giving spots here and there,
but they did not phosphoresce at a greater distance, and the
light was probably not due to the X-rays. Edison attributed
the result directly to the “electrical discharge.” The list is as
follows: ammonium sulphur cyanide, calcic formate, and
nitrate, ferric citrate, argentic nitrate, calcic and iron citrate,
soda, lime, “zinc, cyanide” (perhaps this means cyanide of zinc),
zinc hypermanganate, and zinc valeriate. The salts of the following
metals did not fluoresce under the influence of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>X-rays. Aluminum, antimony, arsenic, boron, beryllium, bismuth,
barium, chromium, cobalt, copper, gold, iridium, magnesium,
manganese, nickel, tin, and titanium.</p>

<p class='c013'>Edison stated that the following substances were among those
which fluoresced more or less under the action of the X-rays.
Mercurous chloride, mercury diphenyl, cadmic iodide, calcic
sulphide, potassic bromide, plumbic tetrametaphosphate, potassic
iodide, plumbic bromide, plumbic sulphate, fluorite, powdered
lead glass, pectolite, sodic cressotinate, ammonic salicylate, and
salicylic acid. Compared with the above, the following fluoresced
less. Powdered German glass, baric, calcic and sodic
fluorides, sodic, mercuric, cadmic, argentic and plumbic chlorides,
plumbic iodide, sodic bromide, cadmic and “cadmium, lithia
bromide, mercury, cadmium sulphate,” uranic sulphate, phosphate,

apatite, calcite, danburnite, calcic carbonate, strontic

natural and artificial ammonium benzoic. Not one of all the
1800 crystals and precipitates fluoresced through a thick cardboard
under the influence of the arc light, 16 inch spark in air,
a vacuum tube so highly exhausted that a 10 inch spark left it
dark, nor the direct rays of the sun at noon time. As calcic
tungstate was phosphorescent by friction, he theorized that the
X-ray is a wave due to concussion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Flame sensitive to X-rays. Edison stated that his assistants
submitted the sensitive flame and the phonographic listening
tube to the action of the X-rays, and found that they were responsive
thereto.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E133'></a>133. <span class='sc'>X-rays Apparently Passed Around a Corner.</span> Referring
to the figure “X-ray Diffusion Fig. <a href='#i129'>1</a>”, p. <a href='#Page_129'>129</a>, it will be
noticed that there were three principal elements. First a discharge
tube, then a thick steel plate and then a sciascope, all
arranged in the proportion indicated in the figure, where the
sciascope was within six inches of the edge of the plate, “well
within the shadow” thereof. <a href='#E69'>§ 69</a>. Fluorescence was seen under
these conditions. When the sciascope was directly behind the
middle of the plate and opposite the discharge tube, there was
no fluorescence, showing that the plate was thick enough to cut
off all the rays and therefore the energy must have traveled in
two directions for some reason or other.</p>

<p class='c008'>Prof. Elihu Thomson remarked concerning this experiment
that he considered, in view of some experiments of his own, on
diffusion and opalescence (<a href='#E103'>§ 103</a>), that the sciascope was luminous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>in view of reflection (<a href='#E146'>§ 146</a>) of the X-rays from various
objects in the room, as from the walls and floor of the room,
tables, metal objects, electrical apparatus and so on. Theory
admits the property of diffraction, which would cause the rays
to turn around the edge of the plate, according to the principles
of diffraction of light, provided the X-rays were due to
transverse or longitudinal or any vibrations. See <i>Elect. Eng.</i>,
N.Y., April 15, p. 378.</p>

<p class='c008'>While Edison generally devotes his energy to actual experiments
and dealings with facts and principles, rather than with
theories, yet, in this instance, he merely suggested that the fluorescence
under the conditions named might indicate that the
propagation of X-rays was similar to that of sound in air, the
wave being of exceedingly short length. He referred to Le
Conte’s experiment of ’82 (see <i>Phil. Mag.</i>, Feb. ’82), where an
experiment of a somewhat similar nature was performed in
connection with the propagation of sound.</p>

</div>
<p class='c013'>Prof. William A. Anthony (see <i>Elect. Eng.</i>, Apr. 3, ’96, p.
378) held that the Le Conte experiment did not warrant
Edison’s conclusion, for the experiment of Le Conte showed
comparatively sharp sound shadows; for even at a distance of
twelve feet there was no apparent penetration within the geometrical
boundary. He referred to Stine’s, <a href='#E110'>§ 110</a>. Scribner and
M’Berty’s, <a href='#E111'>§ 111</a>, as upholding rectilinear propagation. While he
did not explain what the Edison result was due to, yet he argued
that the cause was other than that ascribed by Edison.
In this connection, the author performed an experiment (<i>Elect.
Eng.</i>, Apr. 22, ’96, p. 409) to substantiate that X-rays were
propagated through such a high vacuum that it was necessary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>to have electrodes within 1/8 of an inch of each other, in order
to obtain a discharge with a coil that gave 15 in. spark in open
air. The experiment consisted in casting the shadow of an
<i>uncharged</i> tube upon the screen of a sciascope. The shadows of
the wire forming the electrodes within the vacuum were produced
very sharply, while the glass tube was faintly outlined.
Inasmuch as the shadows of objects <i>within</i> the vacuum tube
were obtained, therefore the X-rays must have passed through
the evacuated space. Sound and X-rays are therefore dissimilar.
The shadows were as sharp and as dark as those made by similar
wires in open air. In this connection, see also Lenard’s
experiment, <a href='#E72'>§ 72</a>, showing that external cathode rays were also
transmitted by a vacuum in a “dead” tube. Roentgen’s experiment
showed that X-rays from a mass located entirely within
the vacuum in the discharge tube radiated X-rays into the outside
atmosphere. <a href='#E91'>§ 91</a>. This experiment would hardly prove,
however, that X-rays, after having been liberated in open air,
would pass through a second vacuum space, because there may
have been some X-rays, generated at the surface of the glass in
Roentgen’s experiment, struck by those rays which radiated
from the mass at the centre of the vacuum space. Did not
Lenard and Roentgen experiment with the same radiant
energy? The author answers, yes. <a href='#E77'>§ 77</a>.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E134'></a>134. <span class='sc'>Permeability of Different Substances.</span> Lenard <a href='#E68'>§ 68</a>.
determined the permeability of several substances to cathode
rays. Roentgen also the same in regard to X-rays. <a href='#E82'>§ 82</a> and <a href='#E83'>83</a>.
Others have made comparisons. From the sciagraph made by
Edison, the following classification is made, each sheet of
material being about 1/32 inch thick. The most opaque were coin
silver, antimony, lead, platinum, bismuth, copper, brass, and
iron, which were about the same as one another. Slate, ivory,
glacial phosphoric acid shellacked, and gutta percha, were about
the same as one another and less than the above. Aluminum,
tin, celluloid, hard rubber, soft rubber, vulcanized fibre, paper,
shellac, gelatine, phonographic cylinder composition, asphalt,
stearic acid, rosin, and albumen, were about the same as one
another and less than the above group, as to permeability.</p>

Power of Light.</span> <i>Elec. Eng.</i>, N.Y., March 4, ’96. Attention
has been invited in the scientific press to the penetrating power
of heat rays and of light rays of low refrangibility. In conjunction
with this, let it be remembered that the photographic plate
has the property of being impressed practically, only by rays
having a higher refrangibility than red. It would be natural,
therefore, to conclude that if the spectrum could be turned
around, the photographic impression might be produced through
opaque bodies. This perhaps, was the kind of reasoning which
prompted Mr. N. D. C. Hodges, formerly editor of <i>Science</i>, to
perform an experiment, the gist of which consisted in attesting
the permeability of rays of light which had been passed through
fuchsine. Christiansen, Soret and Kundt performed experiments
with an alcoholic solution of this material and found that
the order of the colors in the spectrum was somewhat reversed,
namely, violet was the least refracted, then red, and then yellow,
which was the most refracted. Mr. Hodges used a pocket
kodak, carrying a strip for twelve exposures. This camera was
placed in a closely fitting pasteboard box. Thus protected, some
portions of the film were exposed to sunlight, so far as it could
penetrate the end of the pasteboard box, while other exposures
were made with a prism, on the end of the box, containing an
alcoholic solution of fuchsine. The portions of film exposed to
the anomalous rays produced by the fuchsine solution were
fogged, while the control experiments with ordinary light showed
none. The anomalous rays must have penetrated the pasteboard,
and probably the wood and leather of which the camera
was made.</p>

of Temperature.</span> <a href='#E23'>§ 23</a> and <a href='#E72b'>72<i>b</i></a> at end. Among the hundreds
of ideas that occured to Edison in connection with Roentgen
ray tests was that concerning what might happen by cooling the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>discharge tube to a very low temperature. As before, he maintained
the tube in connection with the air pump so as to be able
to vary the vacuum. The reduction of temperature was obtained
by means of ice water. Of course the bulb could not be placed
in the water itself on account of trouble which would occur from
electrolysis, therefore, the discharge tube was immersed in a
vessel of oil, <a href='#E13'>§ 13</a>, which in turn was surrounded by a freezing
mixture. The vessel was a stout battery jar 14 inches high,
eight inches in diameter with glass walls 5/10 of an inch thick.
The oil employed was paraffine. The refrigerating jar was 12
inches high and 12 inches in diameter and the glass wall thereof,
3/8 inch thick. He tested the difference in the power of the rays
by first noticing the thickness of steel that was not penetrated
by the rays generated from the tube while in air. Crucible steel
1/16 of an inch thick did not transmit rays sufficiently to illuminate
the sciascope, and yet with the use of oil and reduction of temperature,
and after the rays had passed through two thicknesses
of glass as well as through the oil and ice water, the sciascope
was made luminous by rays after passing through a plate of
steel of double the thickness, <i><i>i.e.</i></i> 1/8 in. thick. See in this connection,
Tesla’s experiment, <a href='#E135'>§ 135</a>, where powerful rays were
obtained by immersing the discharge tube in oil. Accounts of
these two experiments were published simultaneously. Tesla
attributed the idea of this use of oil to Prof. Trowbridge of
Harvard University, who showed that a discharge tube immersed
in oil is adapted to the generation of X-rays of increased penetrating
power. See cut at p. <a href='#Page_135'>135</a>.</p>

were only slightly reflected (Roentgen, <a href='#E81'>§ 81</a>., and even when
very powerful (Tesla, <a href='#E146'>§ 146</a>., was determined in a severe manner
by Edison. The first experiment consisted in employing a funnel
8 inches long and 3/4 inch at the smaller end. The discharge
tube was in the larger end, and the photographic plate
across the smaller end. After experiment and development,
the plate showed overlapping circular images, which would indicate
reflection from the inner surface of the funnel. This
may have been due to a jarring vibration of the funnel. Therefore,
he carried the experiment further by using a funnel 9 feet
long. The plate did not indicate any signs of reflection, as it
merely became generally fogged. The material of the tube is
not named, but if of brass or other impermeable metal, it is
thought that his experiment would have shown a result agreeing
with that of others herein. Again, the reporter may have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>been in error. Also, the rays may have been very weak, as the
experiment was performed when Edison first started to investigate
the subject.</p>

Discharge Tubes.</span>—Edison exposed covered plates to the direct
sun-light at noon for three or four hours; no photographic impression;
also to electric sparks in open air, of twelve or more
inches in length; no clouding even of the photographic plate.</p>

<p class='c008'>Profs. Rowland et. al., of the Johns Hopkins University, in a
contribution to <i>Electricity</i>, Apr. 22, ’96, p. 219, confirmed this
point by stating: “As to other sources of Roentgen rays, we
have tried a torrent of electric sparks in air from a large battery,
and have obtained none. Of course, coins laid on or near
the plate, under these circumstances, produce impressions, but
these are, of course, induction phenomena.” (See Sandford and
McKay’s Fig. p. <a href='#i020b'>20</a>). “As to sun-light, Tyndall, Abney, Graham,
Bell and others have shown that some of the rays penetrate
vulcanite and other opaque objects.” Poincaré, at an early date,
advanced the hypothesis that X-rays are due to phosphorescence,
whether produced by electrical or other means. <i>Elect.
World</i>, Digest., Mar. 28, ’96, p. 343, where it is also stated that
Chas. Henry thought a certain experiment of his own was in
favor of the hypothesis. The experiment was performed with
a phosphorescent material which had been exposed to the light
and then brought into darkness. Niewengloswski inferred, from
an experiment, that phosphorescent bodies increase the penetrating
power of sun-light. Tesla admitted the possibility of the
radiation of X-rays from the sun. In an article describing important
experiments in the <i>Elect. Rev.</i>, N.Y., Apr. 22, ’96, p.
207, he stated: “I infer, therefore, that the sun-light and
other sources of radiant energy must, in a less degree, emit
radiations or streamers of matter similar to those thrown off by
an electrode in a highly exhausted enclosure. This seems to be
at this moment still a matter of controversy.” Roentgen, in
his first announcement, showed that the phosphorescent spot was
the source of the X-rays. <a href='#E79'>§ § 79</a> and <a href='#E80'>80</a>. All the different opinions
and theories, therefore, indicated that phosphorescence by
sun-light might possibly emit X-rays. Probably few had sufficient
belief in the matter, one way or the other, to try the experiment
in an extreme manner. The author was curious to
prove the question, but he only obtained negative results. It
cannot be conceived how the matter could have been more severely
tested, for he concentrated the light of the sun nearly to
a focus by a large lens, namely 5 in. in diameter, together with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>a reflecting funnel. The maximum phosphorescence was therefore
obtained by placing suitable chemicals at the opening in
the funnel. The sciascope showed absolutely no X-rays present.
Photographic plates were not in the least acted upon, even after
hours of exposure, the same having opaque covers of aluminum.
See <i>Elect. Eng.</i>, N.Y., Apr. 8, ’96, p. 356. If X-rays are
emitted from the sun, they are all absorbed by the atmosphere
of the earth, or are overcome by some other force.</p>

N.Y., March 17, ’96.) Even the ligaments were clearly shown
in the sciagraph of the rat, and some of them are dimly reproduced
by the half tone process. As to the apparatus and operation,
which are especially important, it may be stated that the
current was taken from an alternator, of a frequency of 133
periods per second, and passed through a primary coil of a transformer
for increasing the <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> from 100 volts to from 16 to
25 thousand. The secondary current was then passed through
Leyden jars and a double cascade of slightly separated brass
cylinders, whereby it was changed into an oscillatory current of
an extremely high frequency, which was then conducted through
the primary of a second induction coil having very few turns of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>wire, and no iron core and having a ratio of 7 to 1. By this
means the <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> was raised to somewhere between 160,000
volts to 250,000, and was used to energize the discharge tube for
the generation of X-rays. Caution should be taken, because the
current coming from the first transformer, being of large quantity
and very high <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> is exceedingly dangerous, but the
current of the second secondary has been passed through one’s
body without danger, as reported by Mr. Tesla several years
ago, and confirmed by Mr. Shallenberger.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E138'></a>138. <span class='sc'>Phosphorescent Spot Maintained Cool.</span>—In testing the
power of the X-rays in connection with the appearance of the
phosphorescent spot, Tesla noticed that they were most powerful
when the cathode rays caused the glass to appear as if it
were in a fluid state. <a href='#E61'>§ 61</a>. To prevent actual puncture, he
maintained the spot cool by means of jets of cold air. It became
possible thereby to use bulbs of thin glass at the location
of the generation of the X-rays. <a href='#E119'>§ 119</a>. He concluded from
certain results that not only was glass a better material for
discharge tubes than aluminum, but because, by other tests, he
found that thin aluminum cast more shadow with X-rays than
thicker glass. There are, of course, many other reasons, based
on mechanical construction, why glass is preferable, and also
why a tube with an aluminum window is not to be desired.
Principally, the latter will soon leak.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E139'></a>139. <span class='sc'>Expulsion of Material Particles through the
Walls of a Discharge Tube.</span>—At quite a low vacuum, and
after sealing off the lamp, he attached its terminal to that of
the disruptive coil. After a while, the vacuum became enormously
higher, as indicated by the following steps: First, a turbid
and whitish light existed throughout the bulb. This was
the first principal characteristic. Next, the color changed to
red, and the electrode became very hot, in that case where powerful
apparatus was employed. The precaution should be taken
to regulate the <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span>, to prevent destruction of the electrode.
Gradually, the reddish light subsided, and white cathode rays,
which had begun, grew dimmer and dimmer until invisible. At
the same time, the phosphorescent spot became brighter and
brighter and hotter and hotter, while the electrode cooled, until
the glass adjacent thereto was uncomfortably cold to the touch.
At this stage, the required degree of exhaustion was reached,
and yet without any kind of a pump. He was enabled to hasten
the process by alternate heating and cooling, and by the
use of a small electrode. This whole phenomenon was exhibited
with external electrodes as well. He acknowledged that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>instead of the disruptive coil, a static machine could be used,
or, in fact, any generator or combination of devices adapted to
produce a very high <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span></p>

<p class='c008'>The reduction of temperature of the electrode he attributed
to its volatilization. Without actually testing the rays with a
fluorescent screen or photographic plate, he could always know
their presence by the relative temperatures of the phosphorescent
spot and the electrode, for when the latter was at a low
temperature and the former at a high temperature, X-rays were
sure to be strong.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the fact that the vacuum became higher and higher by
the means stated, he was very much inclined to believe that
there was an expulsion of material particles through the walls of
the bulb. When these particles which were passing with very
great velocities struck the sensitive photographic plate they
should produce chemical action. He referred to the great velocity
of projected particles within a discharge tube, pages <a href='#Page_46'>46</a> and
<a href='#Page_47'>47</a>, and to Lord Kelvin’s estimate upon the same, and reasoned
that with very high potentials, the speed might be 100 km per
second. The phenomenon indicated, he said, that the particles
were projected through the wall of the tube and he entered into
an elaborate discussion on this point. He referred to his own
experiment of causing the rays from an electrode in the open
air to pass directly through a thick glass plate. <a href='#E13'>§ 13</a>. He performed
an experiment also of producing a blackening upon a photographic
plate apparently by the projected particles, an electrical
screen being employed to prevent the formation of sparks. <a href='#E35'>§ 35</a>.
which as well known will cause chemical action upon the plate.
No stronger proof as to the expulsion of material particles could
be desired than an operation in which the eyes can see for
themselves that such an action must have taken place. Usually
he was troubled by the streamers (cathode rays) from the electrode
suddenly breaking the glass of the discharge tube. This
occurred when the spot struck was at or near the point where the
same was sealed from the pump. He arranged a tube in which
the streamers did not strike the sealing point, but rather the side
of the tube. It was extraordinary that a visible but fine hole
was made through the wall of the tube, and especially that no
air rushed into the vacuum. On the other hand, the pressure
of the air was overcome by something rushing out of the tube
through the hole. The glass around the hole was not very hot,
although if care were not taken, it would become much hotter,
and soften and bulge out, also indicating a pressure within, <a href='#E27'>§ 27</a>.
greater than the atmospheric pressure. He maintained the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>punctured tube in this condition for some time and the rarefaction
continued to increase. As to the appearances, the
streamers were not only visible within the tube, but could be
seen passing through the hole, but as the vacuum became higher
and higher, the streamers became less and less bright. At a
little higher degree of vacuum, the streamers were still visible
at the heated spot, but finally disappeared.</p>

<p class='c008'>This electrical process of evacuating varies in its rapidity
according to the thinness of the glass. Here again he noted
the application of his theory in that an easier passage was afforded
for the ions. <a href='#E47'>§ 47</a>. A few minutes of operation produced
through thin glass, a vacuum from very low to very high,
whereas, to obtain the same vacuum through much thicker glass
over 1/2 hour was necessary. Again with a thick electrode the
time required was much greater. The small hole was not
always visible and it was thought that the material went through
the pores. The result obtained by the following experiment
tends to uphold Mr. Tesla’s emission theory.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E139a'></a>139<i>a</i>. <span class='sc'>Lafay’s Experiment. Giving to X-rays the Property
of Being Deflected by a Magnet by Passing Them Through
a Charged Silver Leaf.</span> <i>Comptes Rendus</i>, March 23, ’96 and
April 7, 13, 27, and <i>L’Ind. Elec.</i>, April and May ’96. From
trans. by Louis M. Pignolet. He placed at about .5 cm. below
a discharge tube, a lead screen pierced by a slit 2 mm. wide;
and 0.04 m. lower, a second lead screen having a slit 5 mm. wide
completely covered by an extremely thin leaf of silver. Opposite
the silver leaf and exactly in the axis of the slit, was fixed a
platinum wire 1.5 mm. diameter. Thus, the rays which passed
successively through the two slits projected a shadow of the
wire on a photographic plate below.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the silver leaf was connected to the negative pole of
the induction coil that excited the tube, the rays, which had become
electrified (<a href='#E61b2'>§ 61<i>b</i></a>,  p. <a href='#Page_47'>47</a>) bypassing through the leaf, were
deflected by a magnetic field of about 400 <span class='fss'>L. G. S.</span> units, whose
lines of force were parallel to the slit. The direction of the deflection
was determined by the same law as that of the deflection
by a magnetic field of the cathode rays in the interior of a
discharge tube. <a href='#E59'>§ 59</a>. When the silver leaf was not connected
to the coil, no deflection was produced. <a href='#E79'>§ 79</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>To double the apparent deflection, one part of the slit was
covered by a lead plate during the first half of the experiment.
The lead plate was removed and placed over the other part of
the slit, and the direction of the magnetic field reversed during
the last half of the experiment. Thus the distance on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>sciagraph between the two parts of the wire, was double the deflection
produced by the magnetic field.</p>

<p class='c008'>The deflection was in the same direction when the silver leaf
was connected to the negative pole of a static electric machine,
but was in the opposite direction when the leaf was connected to
the positive pole of the machine. The test was criticised in
the scientific press, and, therefore, in order to be certain that
the deflections observed were not due to the combined effects of
the electro-magnet which produced the magnetic field and the
electric field of the charged silver leaf, the experiments were
modified. To remove this uncertainty, the electrified rays were
caused to enter a grounded Faraday cylinder (see figure at
E. F. G. H., p. <a href='#i048'>47</a>), through a small opening, before passing
between the poles of the electro-magnet. The deviations
which were recorded on a photographic plate in the box were
the same as before.</p>

<p class='c008'>Additional experiments showed that the deflections by the
magnetic field took place as well when the rays were electrified,
after their passage through another magnetic field, as before.
Lafay continued the experiments in great detail and by
many control tests, and he took accurate measurements and
followed the suggestions of others. It would be well for those
who have facilities to repeat these most interesting and important
researches, to determine for themselves some satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is of interest to note that an American, Paul A. N. Winand,
(<i>Mem. Amer. Inst. Elect. Engs.</i>), in the absence of facilities for
experimenting, proposed (<i>Elect. World</i>, N.Y., June 6, ’96) to
interpose a hollow sphere, which had high potential, in the path
of X-rays, and to learn in what manner, if any, the rays are influenced.
He argued that it would seem natural that, inasmuch
as the rays produce a discharge, there should be a reaction of
the charged surface upon the rays.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is evident that if any one repeats these experiments, expert
manipulation is required.</p>

with slightly different glass from four tubes, it seemed
that the cathode rays cause the gases in the tubes to penetrate
the glass where they remain occluded until the glass is nearly
softened (after cutting off the current), by heat, whereby they
are set at liberty as minute bubbles visible by the microscope,
which finally partly combine and become visible to the naked

<p class='c013'><a id='E140'></a>140. <span class='sc'>Discharge Tube Surrounded by a Violet Halo.</span>
By means of enormous potential and high frequency, the tube
was surrounded, Tesla stated, by violet luminosity or halo. <a href='#E6'>§ 6</a>.
and <a href='#E74'>74</a>. From the fact that Lenard obtained a similar appearance
in front of the aluminum window, it might be reasonable
to conclude that there is some close relationship between the
two phenomena.</p>

<p class='c008'>As an illustration of halo by light, may be mentioned the well
known appearance so often occurring in the atmosphere concentrically
with the moon, and sometimes surrounding the sun.
Under favorable circumstances, (in a mist or dust in the air), a
halo, at some distance from a flame or other light is faintly
visible. It has generally been assumed that the reason of a halo
by light is based upon the laws of reflection, or refraction or
both, the bending of the rays taking place, through, or upon the
surface of the particles of moisture. Others have held that
particles of ice in the upper atmosphere, are the reflectors or
refractors, or both. More puzzling has been the attempt to explain
the novel appearance reproduced fairly well in the cut,
page 140. It is here represented in print for the first time, but
the photograph from which it was taken, was at various times,
shown to different physicists, some of whom attributed the
beautiful effect to the property of interference of light, and
naming Newton’s rings as an analogous production. Prof.
Anthony in an interview expressed himself as well satisfied
that interference could not occur under the circumstances named.
He recognized that there was a curved surface of glass which
might be considered as made up of an infinite number of layers.
The author introduces the matter for the purpose of consideration
by others, and especially because it is so intimately connected
with the subject of the vacuum tube and electricity.
The details must be understood for the purpose of proper appreciation.
Mr. William J. Hammer, of New York, had a
photograph taken of the large Concert Hall at the Crystal
Palace, Sydenham, Eng., by the light of the Edison incandescent
lamps with which the Hall was illuminated. This photograph
was made in 1882 during the International Electrical Exhibition
held at the Crystal Palace. The picture shows a small section
of the whole photograph and represents (although probably no
one would judge so by looking at the picture) a festoon of <i>pear</i>-shaped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>incandescent electric lamps, each one hanging downward,
and separated from its neighbor by between <i>three and four</i>
feet. They were so far away from the camera that a picture of
the lamps unlighted, would have represented them as mere
specks. The bright circles with the bright central crosses in
the centre of the dark spaces were, therefore, fully one foot in
diameter, while the lamp bulbs themselves were only about two
or three inches thick, as usual. Why then should there be the
halos? Why should the crosses appear? And why should the
black area be so large? If the electricity and vacuum have
nothing to do with it, why should not the halos appear when
photographs are taken of flames and other sources of light in
the absence of mist and dust? In order to answer questions
which will perhaps be proposed, let it be stated that there was no
visible dust nor moisture in the room, the photograph being
taken early in the evening and at a time when the Hall was not
in use. The halos were not apparent except when reproduced
by a photograph. The lamps had the usual carbon filaments
hanging so that the several filaments were in different planes,
and they were of 16 candle power and were connected in parallel
circuit, the average <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> being about 110 volts. The
lamps were fed by the Edison direct current dynamos. The
festoon shown, is one of a dozen or more which were suspended
between the columns rising from the gallery and supporting the
roof and were hung about forty feet from the floor. The hall
was further illuminated by a huge electrolier pendant from the
centre of the ceiling. These details were obtained from Mr.
Hammer, who planned the installation.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E141'></a>141. <span class='sc'>Anæsthetic Properties of X-rays.</span>—Tesla reported
that he and his assistants tested the action of the rays upon the
human system, and found that upon continued impact and penetration
of the head by very powerful radiations, strange
effects were noticed. He was sure that from this cause a tendency
to sleep occurred (<a href='#E84'>§ 84</a>, at end), and the faculties were benumbed.
He said that time seemed to pass quickly. The
general effect was of a soothing nature, and the top of the head
seemed to feel warm under the influence of the rays. Incidentally,
he noticed, as he stated, “When working with highly
strained bulbs, I frequently experienced a sudden and sometimes
even painful shock in the eye. Such shocks may occur so
often that the eye gets inflamed, and one cannot be considered
cautious if he abstains from watching the bulb too closely.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The author calls to mind the reports in the daily press that
Edison also noticed that the eyes were in some way sensitive to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>the rays. The eye, it was reported, became fatigued at the
time, and yet later, objects could be more easily distinguished.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this connection, it should be remembered that there are
not only cathode rays, X-rays, etc., but the electric force that
Lenard spoke of in the neighborhood of the discharge tube,
and in testing the effects upon the eyes, of course, the precaution
should be taken to determine whether cathode rays, X-rays
or the electric sparks are answerable for the peculiar effects.
Roentgen reasoned, <a href='#E84'>§ 84</a>, that the eyes were not sensitive, but
the rays, in his case, were not strong enough to travel 40 to
60 feet, as in Tesla’s experiments, but only 2 m. (about 7 ft.).</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E142'></a>142. <span class='sc'>Sciagraphs of Hair, Fur, Heart, Etc., by X-rays.</span>—Tesla
was probably the first to be at all successful in the representation
in sciagraphs of such objects as hair and cloth and
similar easily permeable objects. In the case of a rabbit, not
only was the skeleton visible, but also the fur. Sciagraphs of
birds exhibited the feathers fairly distinctly. The picture of a
foot in a shoe not only represented the bones of the foot, and
nails of the shoe, but every fold of the leather, trowsers, stockings,
etc. His opinion as to the useful application of the rays
was that any metal object, or bony or chalky deposit could be
“infallibly detected in any part of the body.” In obtaining a
sciagraph of a skull, vertebral column, and arm, even the
shadows of the hair were clearly apparent. It was during such
an experiment that the anæsthetic qualities were noticed. The
author saw several of the above named sciagraphs. Furthermore,
on the screen he believed he detected the pulsations of
the heart. <i>Elect. Rev.</i>, N.Y., May, 20, ’96.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although we do not doubt this report concerning what Mr.
Tesla saw, yet some scientific men are exceedingly dubious
concerning the results obtained by other scientists, unless the
same are confirmed by additional witnesses. It will certainly
be of interest to such skeptics to have corroboratory evidence.
In company with Prof. Anthony, Mr. Wm. J. Hammer and Mr.
Price, editor of the <i>Elect. Rev.</i>, N.Y., the author visited a laboratory
at 31 West 55th street, New York City, for the purpose of
beholding the pulsations of the human heart by means of an
experiment performed by Mr. H. D. Hawkes, of Tarrytown,
N.Y. There was nothing new about his apparatus, the admirable
results being due merely to accurately proportioned electrical
and mechanical details and skillful manipulation. The
Tesla system was not used, but merely a large induction coil and
rotary interrupter, and a direct current from the incandescent
lamp circuit of 110 volts, all substantially as Roentgen himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>employed. The sciascope was provided with the Edison calcic
tungstate screen. In order to overcome the sparking between
the terminals on the outside of the tube after a few minutes of
use, he heated the cathode end by means of a Bunsen burner
flame. <a href='#E139'>§ 139</a>, near beginning. The utility consisted in the
evaporation of condensed moisture upon the cool end of the
discharge tube. The temporary heating always prevented, for
several minutes, any sparking on the outside. After some
preliminary experiments, each person, in turn, pressed the sciascope
upon the breast of another, at the location of the heart,
while the discharge tube was directly at the back of a young
man. The ribs and spinal column were visible, and, projecting
from the spine, appeared a semi-circular area, which expanded
and contracted. Any one viewing such an operation, and knowing
that he is looking at the movements of the heart, cannot
but be impressed with weird wonder, and cannot but credit great
honor, not only to Roentgen and Lenard, but to all those early
workers who have gradually but surely, successfully made discovery
after discovery in the department of the science of discharges,
finally culminating in the most wonderful discovery
of all.</p>

<p class='c008'>The author remembers seeing in some medical paper that
William J. Morton, M.D., of New York, had also witnessed the
beating of the heart with the sciascope at an early date. Similar
reports are occurring weekly.</p>

<p class='c008'><a id='E142a'></a>§ 142<i>a</i>. Mr. Norton, of Boston (<i>Elect. World.</i>, N.Y., May 23,
’96) also stated that the heart could be seen in faint outline, and
also its pulsations. The lungs were very transparent. The
liver being quite opaque, its rise and fall with the diaphragm
was plainly followed. Others have suggested drinking an
opaque (to X-rays) liquid, like salt water, and tracing its path.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E143'></a>143. <span class='sc'>Propagation of X-rays through Air to Distances of
60 Ft.</span>—In Roentgen’s first experiments, the maximum distances
at which the fluorescent screen was excited was about
7 ft. Tesla obtained similar action at a distance of over 40 ft.
Photographic plates were found clouded if left at a distance of
60 ft. for any length of time. This trouble occurred when some
plates were in the floor above and 60 ft. distant from the discharge
tube. He attributed the wonderful increase largely to
the employment of a single electrode discharge tube, because
the same permitted the highest obtainable <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> that could be
desired.</p>

<p class='c013'><a id='E144'></a>144. <span class='sc'>X-rays with Poor Vacuum and High Potential.</span>—In
the course of Tesla’s experiments, he observed that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Crookes’ phenomena and X-rays could be produced without the
high degree of vacuum usually considered necessary, <a href='#E118'>§ 118</a>.
but by way of compensation, the <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> must be exceedingly
high, and, of course, the tube and electrical apparatus substantially
of those dimensions involved in Tesla’s work. One
must be careful not to over-heat the discharge tube, which is
likely to occur by increase of potential. He gave definite instructions
for preventing the destruction of the tube by heating,
by stating that it is only necessary to reduce the number of impulses,
or to lengthen their duration, while at the same time
raising their potential. For this purpose, it is best to have a
rotary circuit interrupter in the primary instead of a vibrating
make and break, for then it becomes convenient to vary the
speed of the interrupter, which may be, evidently, so constructed
that the duration of the impulses may also be varied,
for example, by different sets of contact points arranged on the
rotary interrupter, and made of different widths.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E145'></a>145. <span class='sc'>Detail Construction and Use of Single Electrode
Discharge Tubes for X-rays.</span> He pointed out that with two
electrodes in a bulb as previously employed by nearly all experimenters,
or an internal one in combination with an adjacent
external one the <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> applicable was necessarily greatly limited
for the reason that the presence of both, or the nearness of any
conducting object “had the effect of producing the practicable
potential on the cathode.” Consequently he was driven, as he
said, to a discharge tube having a single internal electrode, the
other one being as far away as required. <a href='#E9'>§ 9</a>. In view of his
ingenious arrangements of the disruptive coil, and circuits, condensers
and static screens for the bulb, he found it immaterial
to pay attention to some other details followed by experimenters.
For example, it made comparatively little difference in
his results whether the electrode was a flat disk or had a concave
surface.</p>

</div>
<p class='c013'>The form of tube described by Tesla in full, will hereinafter
be alluded to as exhibited in the several figures accompanying
this description, and it consisted, therefore, of the long tube “<i>b</i>”
made of very thick glass except at the end opposite the electrode
“<i>e</i>”, where it was blown thin, p. <a href='#i149'>149</a>. The electrode was an aluminum
disk having a diameter only slightly less than that of the
tube and located about one inch beyond the rather long narrow
neck <i>n</i>, into which the leading-in wire <i>c</i> entered. It is important
that a wrapping <i>w</i> be provided around this wire, both inside and
outside of the tube. The sealing point was on the side of the
neck. An electric screen has been referred to heretofore. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>lettered <i>s</i>, and was formed of a coating of bronze paint applied
on the glass between the electrode and neck <i>n</i>. The screen
could be made in other ways, for example, as shown at <i>s</i>, Fig. <a href='#i149'>2</a>,
where it consists of an annular disk behind and parallel to the
electrode disk. This ring <i>s</i> in Fig. <a href='#i149'>2.</a> must be placed at the right
distance back of the electrode <i>e</i>, but just how far can only be
determined by experience. The unique service of the screen
was that of an automatic system for preventing the vacuum
from becoming too high by use. The peculiar action was as
follows, namely from time to time, a spark jumped through the
wrapping <i>w</i> within the tube to the screen and liberated just
about enough gas to maintain the vacuum at an approximately
constant degree. Another way in which he was able to guard
against too high a vacuum, consisted in extending the wrapping
<i>w</i> to such a distance inside of the tube, that the same became
heated sufficiently to liberate occluded gases. As to the long
length of the leading-in wire within a long neck behind the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>cathode, Lenard found the same to be valuable in conjunction
with a wrapping around the wire. With high potential, a spark,
at a certain high degree of vacuum, formed behind the electrode,
and prevented the use of very high potential, but by having the
wire extend far into the tube and providing wrappers, the sparking
was much less likely to occur. By proper adjustment as
before intimated, Tesla could produce just about enough to
compensate for the electrical increase of the vacuum. Another
difficulty that presented itself in connection with high <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span>
was the undue formation of streamers heretofore referred to,
apparently issuing from the glass, and so often disabling it. He
therefore immersed the discharge tube in oil as pointed out in
detail hereinafter. The walls of the tube served to throw forward
to the thin glass many of those rays that otherwise would
have been scattered laterally. Upon comparing a long thick
tube of this kind with a spherical one, the sensitive plate was
acted upon by the rays in 1/4 the time with the tube. A modification
consisted in surrounding a lower portion of the tube,
with an outside terminal <i>e</i>, indicated in dotted lines in Fig. <a href='#i149'>1</a>.
In this way the discharge tube had two terminals. The greatest
advantage probably in using a long tube, was that the longer
it was, within the proper limits, the greater the potential which
could be applied with advantages. As to the aluminum electrode,
he noticed that it was superior, in comparison with one
made of platinum which gave inferior results, and caused the bulb
to become disabled in an inconveniently short period of time.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E146'></a>146. <span class='sc'>Percentage of Reflected X-rays.</span> He performed some
preliminary experiments, testing roughly as to whether any appreciable
amount of radiation could be reflected or not from
any given surface. Within 45 minutes he was enabled to obtain
clear and sharp sciagraphs of metal objects, and the same could
have been obtained only by the reflected rays, because he
screened the direct rays by means of very thick copper. By a
rough calculation he found that the percentage of the total
amount of rays reflected was somewhere in the neighborhood of
2 per cent.</p>

<p class='c008'>Prof. Rood, of Columbia University, N.Y., (<i>Sci.</i>, Mar. 27, ’96.)
by means of an experiment with platinum foil, <a href='#E80'>§ 80</a>, concluded
that the per centage was about .005, the incident angle being
45 degrees. He regarded this figure as the mere first approximation.
Judging from Roentgen, <a href='#E85'>§ 85</a>, Tesla, Rood and others,
therefore, it seems to be established that the percentage of
X-rays reflected is very small.</p>

<p class='c008'>Prof. Mayer, of Stevens Institute, (<i>Science</i>, May 8, ’96,) is of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>the opinion that there is a regular or specular reflection, having
witnessed some experiments obtained by Prof. Rood, of Columbia
Univ., N.Y. Prof. Mayer reported that the original negatives
were taken in such a way as to substantiate regular
reflection, and were carefully examined by six eminent physicists
at the <i>National Acad. of Sci.</i> at Washington, April 23, ’96,
and none had the slightest doubt concerning the completeness
of the demonstration. The material employed for reflecting
was platinum foil. <a href='#E103a'>§ 103<i>a</i></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='sc'>Difference Between Diffusion and Reflection.</span> Judging
from the experiments above related, as well as those considered
in <a href='#E103a'>§ 103<i>a</i></a>, there might at first appear to be contradictory results,
reported by different authorities. Experts, it is thought will,
without argument, discover the harmonious agreement, and will
commend the work of scientists, who, in different parts of the
world, and at about the same time, made similar experiments,
which now being considered jointly, are found to agree so wonderfully
closely. Upon reading the above sections and those
referred to, there can be no doubt whatever but that X-rays,
upon striking a body are, to a certain per cent. scattered, or
thrown back, or bent from their straight course, and sent in a
backward and different direction, at one angle or another. The
only apparent absolute contradiction to this is that of Perrin,
<a href='#E103a'>§ 103<i>a</i></a>, <i>near the end</i>. But his is a case of one witness against
scores, and, therefore, evidence based upon his experiments,
must be counted out. The error was either due to some oversight
of his own, or more probably the mistake is merely a
typographical one, for often a mistake creeps in between a man’s
dictation and the printed work. It is difficult to accuse Perrin
of a mistake, for he is a great French authority in such matters.
Assuming that no error has occured, let it be noticed that he does
not pronounce non-reflection from all substances, but only from
steel p. <a href='#Page_154'>154</a>, l. 9, and flint, which have been so polished as to form
a mirror-like surface, whereas all other experimenters, with
scarcely an exception, have not employed such surfaces. The
difficult point to believe is that, after six hours, no energy from
the mirror could be collected. If we accept Perrin’s results it
must be only in regard to those two particular materials, polished
steel and flint. Another feature which is on the edge of
conjecture, is that of true or specular reflection, referred to by
Prof. Mayer, <a href='#E146'>§ 146</a>. Many attempts have been undertaken to
prove whether the rays were thrown backward on the principle
of reflection as light from a mirror, or of diffusion as light from
chalk. Let the student notice that the evidence is overwhelming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>in favor of the turning back of the rays to a very small per cent.
upon striking any object. As to specular reflection, which means
similar to the reflection of light from a polished mirror, it is
practically the same as diffusion, the difference being substantially
of a technical nature. This allegation is based upon the detail
distinction between reflection and diffusion given by P. G. Tait,
professor of natural philosophy, Univ. of Edinburgh, who states,
in <i>Encyclo. Brit.</i>, vol. 141, p. 586:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“It is by scattered light that non-luminous objects are, in general,
made visible. Contrast, for instance, the effect when a ray
of sunlight in a dark room falls upon a piece of polished silver,
and when it falls on a piece of chalk. Unless there be dust
or scratches on the silver, you cannot see it, because no light
is given from it from surrounding bodies except in one definite
direction, into which (practically) the whole ray of sunlight is
diverted. But the chalk sends light to all surrounding bodies,
from which any part of its illuminated sides can be seen; and
there is no special direction in which it sends a more powerful
ray than in others. It is probable that if we could, with sufficient
closeness, examine the surface of the chalk, we should
find its behavior to be in the nature of reflection, but reflection
due to <i>little mirrors</i> inclined to all conceivable aspects, and to all
conceivable angles to the incident light. <i>Thus scattering may be
looked upon as ultimately due to reflection.</i> When the sea is perfectly
calm, we see it in one intolerably bright image of the sun only.
But when it is continuously covered with slight ripples, the definite
image is broken up, and we have a large surface of the
water shining by what is virtually scattered light, though it is
really made up of parts each of which is as truly reflected as it
was when the surface was flat.”</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E146a'></a>146<i>a</i>. <span class='sc'>Reflected and Transmitted X-rays Compared.</span>—In
order to carry on a series of investigations, Mr. Tesla constructed
a complete special apparatus represented in Fig. <a href='#i149'>2</a>, p.
<a href='#i149'>149</a>, and embodied in it also an idea which he attributed to Prof.
William A. Anthony, which consisted in arranging for sciagraphs
to be produced by the rays transmitted through the reflecting
substance as well as by the reflected rays themselves.
The figure serves to show at a glance the construction and,
therefore, the explanation need be but brief. It consisted of a
<i>T</i> tube, having three openings, those at the base and side being
closed by photographic plates in their opaque holders, which carried
on the outside the objects <i>o</i> and <i>o´</i> to be sciagraphed. At an
angle to both plates, and centrally located, was a reflecting
plate, <i>r</i>, which could be replaced by plates of different materials.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>At the upper opening of the plate <i>B</i> was a discharge tube,
<i>b</i>, placed in a heavy Bohemian glass tube, <i>t</i>, to direct the scattered
rays downward as much as possible from the electrode, <i>e</i>,
to and through the thin end of the discharge tube. The objects
to be sciagraphed, namely <i>o</i> and <i>o´</i>, were exact duplicates of
each other. No statement could be found as to the thickness of
the tested plates, <i>r</i>, except that they were all of equal size.
The distance from the bottom of the discharge tube to the reflecting
plate, <i>r</i>, was 13 inches, and from the latter to each photographic
plate about 7 inches, so that both pencils of rays had
to travel 20 inches in each instance. One hour was taken as
the time of exposure. After a series of experiments with a
great many different kinds of metals, they arranged themselves
as to their reflecting power, in an order corresponding to Volta’s
electric contact series in air. <a href='#E153'>§ 153</a>. The most electro-positive
metal was the best reflector, and so on. For exhaustive investigations
upon the discovery of Volta, see <i>“Experimental Researches”
of Kohlrausch, Pogg. Ann., ’53</i>, and Gerland, <i>Pogg. Ann.,
’68</i>. The metals Tesla tested were zinc, lead, tin, copper and
silver, which were, in their order, less and less reflecting, and
the order is the same in the electro-positive series, zinc being the
most positive, and the others less and less so, in the order named.
For a complete list of the metals arranged by the Volta series,
see any standard electrical text-book. He could not notice
much difference between the reflecting powers of tin and
lead, but he attributed this to an error in the observation.</p>

<p class='c008'>He tried other metals, but they were either alloys or impure.
Those named in the list above were the pure metals. However,
he carried on experiments with sheets of many different
substances, and arrived at the following table, which shows particularly
the relative transmitting and reflecting powers of the
various substances in the rough.</p>

<p class='c013'>He stated that while these figures can be but rough approximations,
there is, nevertheless a fair probability that they are
correct, in so far as the relative values of the sciagraphic impressions
of the various objects by reflected rays are concerned.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to devise means for testing the comparative reflecting
power in a more decided manner, he laid pieces of different
metals side by side upon a lead plate. Consequently the reflecting
surface was formed of two parts corresponding to the two
metals. <a href='#E80'>§ 80</a>. The vertically perpendicular partition of lead
served to prevent the mingling of the rays from the two metals.
Ingenious precautions were taken; as for example, so arranging
matters that upon equal areas of the two plates, equal amounts
of X-rays impinged. <a href='#E80'>§ 80</a>. He undertook to determine the position
of iron in the series by thus comparing it with copper. It
was impossible to be sure which metal reflected better. The
same regarding tin and lead and also in reference to magnesium
and zinc. Here, a difference was noticed, namely that the magnesium
was a better reflector.</p>

<p class='c008'>He has made practical application of the power of the substances
to reflect a certain per cent. of the rays by employing
reflectors for the purpose of reducing the time required for exposure
of the photographic plates. It admits, he stated, of the
use of reflectors in combination with a whole set of discharge
tubes, whereby rays which would be otherwise scattered in all
directions are brought more nearly to a single direction of
propagation.</p>

<p class='c013'>It might be argued, that in as much as zinc would reflect only
about three per cent. of the incident rays, no practical gain would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>ensue in sciagraphy by the use of a reflector. He pointed out
the falsity of such an argument. In the first place, the angle
employed in these tests was 45°. With greater angles, the proportion
of reflected rays would be greater assuming that the law
of reflection is the same as that of light. By mathematical calculation
and tests, he showed that there was no doubt whatever
about the advantage of using reflectors. He obtained a sciagraph,
on a single plate, of the ribs, arms and shoulder, clearly
represented. He stated the details as follows. “A funnel
shaped zinc reflector two feet high, with an opening of five inches
at the bottom and 23 inches at the top, was used in the experiment.
A tube similar in every respect to those previously
described, was suspended in the funnel, so that only the static
screen of the tube was above the former. The exact distance
from the electrode to the sensitive plate was four and one-half
feet.”</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E147'></a>147. <span class='sc'>Discharge Tube Placed in Oil.</span>—When the <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span> was
increased, by having the discharge tube, as usual, in open air,
sparks formed behind the electrode, and within the vacuum,
and endangered the life of the discharge tube. He obviated
this difficulty partly by having the electrode located well within
the evacuated space, so that the wire leading to it was unusually
long. By excessive <span class='fss'>E. M. F.</span>, also, streamers broke out at the
end of the tube. To overcome all difficulties in connection
with sparking and breaking of the tube, he followed the proposition
of Prof. Trowbridge, and submerged the discharge tube
in oil, <a href='#E11'>§ 11</a>, at end, and <a href='#E13'>§ 13</a>, which was continually renewed by
flowing into and out of the vessel in which the discharge tube
was contained, all as shown in the accompanying figure, p. <a href='#i157'>157</a>,
“Discharge Tube Immersed in Oil.” The discharge tube, <i>t</i>,
may be recognized by its shape, and it is located horizontally
in a cylindrical tube lying sidewise upon a table. To regulate
the flow of the oil, the reservoir may be raised and lowered by
a bracket, s. The X-rays enter the outside atmosphere by
passing first through glass, then oil, and then through a diaphragm
of “pergament” forming the right hand end of the
oil vessel. When the results were compared with those obtained
by Roentgen in his first experiments, the rays were
found so powerful that it is not surprising that Tesla was able
to obtain more definitely a closer knowledge of the properties
of the rays. Roentgen obtained, with his tube and a screen
of barium platino cyanide, a shadow picture of the bones of
the hand at a distance of less than 7 ft., while Tesla obtained
a similar picture with a screen of calcic tungstate, and with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>his tube immersed in oil at a distance of 45 ft. Tesla also made
sciagraphs with but a few minutes’ exposure at a distance of
40 ft., by the help of Prof. Henry’s method, <i><i>i.e.</i></i>, with the assistance
of a fluorescent powder. <a href='#E151'>§ 151</a>. He referred also to Salvioni’s
suggestion of a fluorescent emulsion. He attributed
to Mr. E. R. Hewitt the conjecture that the sharpness of the
sciagraphs might be increased by a thin aluminum sheet having
parallel groves. Several experiments were made, therefore,
with wire gauze, as well as with a screen formed of a
mixture of fluorescent and iron-fluorescent powders. With the
strong power of the rays as obtained by Tesla in combination
with such adjuncts, the shadows were sharper, although the radiation,
of course, was weakened by the obstruction. <a href='#E107b'>§ 107<i>b</i></a>.</p>

</div>
<p class='c013'>With the apparatus involving the discharge tube in oil, and
with tremendously high potential, he obtained what may be
called wonderful results; for with the sciascope he obtained
shadow pictures of the vertebral column, outline of the hip bones,
the location of the heart (and later detected its pulsations), ribs
and shorter bones, and, without the least difficulty, the bones of
all the limbs. More than this, a sciagraph of the skeleton of the
hand was perceived through copper, iron or brass very nearly
1/4 inch thick, while glass 1/2 inch thick scarcely dimmed the fluorescence.
The skull of the head of an assistant acted likewise,
while at a distance of three feet from the discharge tube.
The motion of the hand was detected upon the screen although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>the rays first passed through one’s body. In making observations
with the screen, he advised that experimenters should surround
the oil box closely, except at the end, with thick metal plates, to
prevent X-rays from coming in undesired directions by reflection
from different objects in the room. Obviously the shadows will
be sharper.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E148'></a>148. <span class='sc'>Bodies Not Made Conductors by X-rays.</span> Tesla referred
to Prof. J. J. Thomson as having announced some time
ago “that all bodies traversed by Roentgen radiations become
conductors of electricity.” The author has witnessed other similar
expressions giving credit to Thomson in this respect, but he
understands that Prof. Thomson, having discovered that X-rays
discharge both negatively and positively charged bodies, conjectured
or drew a corallary as to the probability of the bodies
therefore becoming conductors. Tesla, nevertheless, seems to
have proved that the corallary does not hold. In the first place
he employed the very powerful rays, and next, he let the oil be
the substance traversed by the rays. Besides this, he applied a
sensitive resonance test. See detail treatment of his experiments
on this subject in <i>Elect. Rev.</i>, N.Y., June 24, ’93, p. 228. In brief
“a secondary not in very close inductive relation to the primary
circuit, was connected to the latter and to the ground, and the
vibration through the primary was so adjusted that true resonance
took place. As the secondary had a considerable number
of turns, very small bodies attached to the free terminal produced
considerable variations of potential of the latter. Placing a tube
in a box of wood filled with oil and attaching it to the terminal,
I adjusted the vibration through the primary so that resonance
took place without the bulb radiating Roentgen rays to any appreciable
extent. I then changed the conditions so that the
bulb became very active in the production of the rays.”</p>

<p class='c008'>According to the corallary above referred to, the oil should be,
with such an environment and under such subjection, a conductor
of electricity, but it was not. He emphasized his satisfaction
in the results by saying “the method I followed is so
delicate that a mistake is almost an impossibility.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Prof. W. C. Peckham, <i>Elect. World</i>, N.Y., May 30, ’96, reasoned
that the oscillating electro-static action upon the outside of the
tube, is concerned in the production of fluorescence, and other
properties of X-rays. “These oscillations are certainly synchronous
with the vibrations of the cathode rays in the tube, which in
turn synchronize with the oscillation in the induction coil. If
the vibrations of the tube cannot keep time with those of its
coil, few or no X-rays will be given out. The cause seems to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>be similar to that of sympathetic vibrations in sound. In a word,
the discharge tube is a resonator for its coil, and when the coil
and tube are properly attuned, the maximum effect is obtained.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E149'></a>149. <span class='sc'>Appleyard’s Experiment. Non-conductors Made Conductors
by Current.</span> <i>Proc. Phil. So.</i>, May 11, <i>Nature</i>, Lon.,
May 24, ’64, p. 93. A piece of celluloid was pressed between two
metal plates serving as terminals. A galvanometer was employed
to indicate the diminution of resistance by time, and it
also showed that the electrification was negative. When mercury
was one of the metals, the abnormal results did not occur,
except to a very small extent. When the celluloid was replaced
by gutta percha tissue, the electrification was normal. Many
non-metals were employed, and several were lowered in resistance.</p>

non-conducting
materials, like a sheet of gutta percha, having brass filings imbedded
therein,—with 750 volts, no current passed, and this
held true until the proportion in weight of the metal to the
gutta percha was 2 to 1. Let it be remembered, also, that selenium
is reduced as to resistance under the influence of light.</p>

Waves.</span> <i>Nature</i>, Lon., May 24, ’94, p. 93.—Referring
to Appleyard’s experiment, it will be noticed that he
found that mixtures of certain limited per cents. of metallic
particles and insulators were exceedingly high in resistance.
Prof. G. M. Minchin found that such materials became
conductors under the influence of powerful electro-magnetic
disturbances, and that after the current was conducted, its
resistance remained greatly lowered in behalf of very weak
impulses, although, before the experiment, the resistance was so
high. <a href='#E14a'>§ 14<i>a</i></a>. But after the current was interrupted by moving
the terminal away from the mixture, the high resisting power
returned slowly, at a rate somewhat in proportion to the hardness
of the mixture. The film employed consisted of shellac
or gelatine or sealing wax, while among the metals was pulverized
tin. In the latter case, the resistance was reduced by the
electro-magnetic waves from apparent infinity to 130 ohms, the
electrodes being displaced by 1 cm.</p>

Feb. 12, ’96—the author saw him use it Feb. 7, ’96—), was
among the first, and probably actually the first, to lessen the
time of exposure by a fluorescent screen. Prof. Salvioni also
worked in this direction at an early date. Prof. Swinton reported
some details in the matter, and he was able to obtain a
sciagraph of the bones of the hand in less than 10 seconds,
with a moderately excited discharge tube, whereas, without the
screen the time was two minutes. He experimented first with
barium platino cyanide, but the results referred to were obtained
with calcic tungstate, finely ground, and made up into
paste by means of gum, and dried. He spread the same upon a
celluloid sheet which was placed with the celluloid side against
the photographic film. The difficulty experienced first was in
the formation of spots on the negative, because some of the
crystals fluoresced more than others. Such a defect, however,
showed that the fluorescent salt increased the rapidity
of the action upon the photographic film. The result of this
experiment, as well as that of others, has sufficiently established
the fact that the fluorescent screen is of great importance
in connection with the art of rapid sciagraphy.</p>

higher and higher. At the first generation of the X-rays, the

dark shadows. With increase of the vacuum, the shadows of
the bones were very faint. This result is also obtained by reduction
of temperature. <a href='#E152a'>§ 152<i>a</i></a>.</p>

<i>The Elect.</i>, Lon., Apr. 24, ’96, p. 857. J. R. E. Murray of the
Cavendish Laboratory, at the suggestion of Prof. J. J. Thomson,
carried on a long series of careful experiments, to find whether
the contact potential of a pair of plates of different metals was,
in any way, affected by the passage of X-rays between the plates.
All the ordinary precautions were taken. The contact potential
was measured by Thomson’s (Kelvin) method, see <i>Trans. Brit.
Asso.</i>, 1880. The important result obtained, was that “the air
through which the rays pass, <a href='#E90'>§ 90</a>, is temporarily converted into
an electrolyte, <a href='#E47'>§ 47</a>, and when in this condition forms a connection
between the plates, which has the same properties as a
drop of acidulated water, namely, it rapidly reduces the potential
between the opposing surfaces of the plates to zero, and may
even reverse it to a small extent.”</p>

Colored Media to the X-rays.</span> <i>Comptes Rendus</i>, Feb. 3, ’96.
From trans. by Louis M. Pignolet. The rays were passed
through two openings in a thick metal diaphragm, one of which
was covered by an uncolored piece of gelatine and the other by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>a piece tinted with the color to be tested. The two images were
received on the same plate. The various colors tested were
traversed with equal facility by the rays, <a href='#E68'>§ 68</a> and <a href='#E82'>82</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The investigation described above was made by Albert Nodon
at the Laboratoire des Recherches Physiques à la Sorbonne.</p>

<p class='c008'>This agrees with Bleunard who found that colors seemed to
have no influence on the passage of the rays as water colored

<p class='c008'>A. and L. Lumière (<i>Comptes Rendus</i>, Feb. 17, ’96,) observed
that the X-rays act in the same manner upon colored photographic
plates rendered sensitive to various regions of the spectrum.
Thus, plates sensitive to red, yellow and green gave
exactly the same impression, provided they had the same general
sensibility to white light. While this may not be accurately so,
it illustrates that materials are penetrated by X-rays independently
of the laws of color.</p>

also organic substances containing, besides carbon, only
the gaseous elements hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen; but this
transparency was far from uniform. Organic substances,—ethers,
acids, nitrogenized compounds (<i>corps azotes</i>),—were
easily traversed by the rays; but the introduction of an inorganic
element, as particularly, chlorine, sulphur, phosphorus, and,
above all, iodine, renders them opaque. <a href='#E82'>§ 82</a>. This occurs also
with sulphates of the alkaloids. Iodoform, the alkaloids, picric
acid, fuchsine and urea are very transparent. Metallic salts are
very opaque, but this varies with the metal and the acid.
Bleunard went further into details. The opacity of solutions of
salts increased with the atomic weight of the metal and of the
metalloid. Water was easily traversed by the rays. Solutions
of bromide of potassium, chloride of antimony, bichromate of
potash offered considerable opposition to the passage of the
rays. Solutions of borate of soda, permanganate of potassium
were easily traversed. The liquids were held in paper boxes.
The experiments above related were conducted by Maurice

was not inclined to confirm such action. A. Foutana and A.
Uruanni made experiments and concluded that the action was
due to an electro-static force, having noticed that a Leyden jar
would also produce such effect. The author made some experiments
to determine the matter in reference to X-rays at a distance
outside of the electro-static field. The rays would neither
stop the vanes nor cause them to rotate. He made some other
experiments to detect whether there was any direct mechanical
power possessed by the rays; but if any, it was exceedingly feeble.</p>

<p class='c008'>T. C. Porter made some experiments at Eton College, (<i>Nature</i>,
June 18, ’96,) which confirmed the above results, finding that
the radiometer is entirely inert to the Roentgen rays, whether

<p class='c013'><a id='E164'></a>164. <span class='sc'>Battelli’s Experiment. X-Rays Within Discharge
Tube.</span> <i>Nuovo Cimento</i>, Apr., ’96, p. 193; <i>Elect. Rev.</i>, Lon., June
12, ’96.—Shortly after the announcement of the discoveries of
Lenard and Roentgen, it would have been considered strange to
assert that X-rays may exist inside of the discharge tube. Battelli
certainly correctly infers, that inasmuch as X-rays apparently
originate from the point where a material object is struck
by the cathode rays, <a href='#E115'>§ 115</a>, it would follow that when the said
object is within the vacuum space, X-rays are propagated before
they reach the glass wall of the discharge tube. It has already
been noted (DeMetz, <a href='#E63a'>§ 63<i>a</i></a>) that photographic action may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>produced within the discharge tube. Battelli has confirmed
this, not by a crude experiment, like that (failure) of some authority
in England, but by a series of severe tests, leaving no
doubt as to the production of photographic action. He discovered
in connection with several subordinate phenomena that
among the rays capable of producing a photographic impression
within the discharge tube, some were deflected by a magnet and
others were not, from which he concluded that X-rays may exist
inside the tube, in conjunction with cathode rays, before collision
with the anti-cathode. The experiment consisted in deflecting
the rays by a magnet, the film being in the path that
the rays would have had without a magnet. There was also a
film in the path of the deflected rays. Photographic action was
produced upon both. He varied the vacuum. Photographic
action began at 3-10 mm., had its maximum at 1-70 mm., after
which it remained constant. No photographic action was obtained
upon a film placed within the tube opposite the anode,
except in one case where it was exceedingly weak. Lenard
continually inferred that there must be two kinds of cathode
rays. <a href='#E75'>§ 75</a>. Battelli has certainly sifted the two rays apart and
thus proved Lenard’s conjectures. <a href='#E61b2'>§ 61<i>b</i></a>, p. <a href='#Page_47'>47</a>. <i>The Elect. Rev.</i>,
Lon., pays tribute to Battelli, by offering the following opinion:
“We have no hesitation in saying that Battelli, by means of interesting
and ingenious experiments, has made the greatest
advances in the theory of the X-rays since their discovery by
Roentgen.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In many cases the author has omitted stating, in taking sciagraphs,
that the films were protected from ordinary light by
opaque material. This, as a matter of course, has always been
understood. Battelli also had the films wrapped in material
opaque to ordinary light. Experimenters should, if possible,
always employ aluminum for this purpose, because the author
has always noticed that black paper or cloth permits a great deal
of light to come through, even when in double thickness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Prof. Sylvanus P. Thompson (<i>The Electr.</i>, Lon., June 26, ’96)
located a wire in a focus tube in the path of the rays between
the platinum reflector and the wall of the tube. Not only was
there a sciagraph of this wire produced in the sciascope, but also
the Crookesian shadow of the wire on the wall of the bulb.
For this experiment the exhaustion must be quite high. “At
no state of exhaustion did the platinum reflector convert all the
internal cathode rays into X-rays.” Both shadows were cast
by the platinum reflector as the origin. More or less of the rays
between the reflector and the glass were sensitive to a magnet.</p>

<i>Elect. Eng.</i>, July 1, ’96; <i>Royal Acad. Med. &amp; Sur.</i>, of Naples,
Italy.—As early as April 7, J. Mount Bleyer, M.D., of
Naples, constructed and used the apparatus shown in the adjacent
cut, p. <a href='#i169'>169</a>. The picture is self-explanatory. Attached to an
ordinary camera is a flaring sciascope, for receiving the temporary
sciagraph of the hand, for example. The X-rays are
converted into luminous rays by the fluorescent screen, and,
therefore, the camera will serve to take a picture by means of
the luminous rays from the sciagraph of the hand. The cut
represents also an induction coil and a discharge tube. Soon
afterwards, it was reported by an English paper that Dr. Levy,
of Berlin, and others of England, had also made similar tests
with success. In order to illustrate the applicability of the combination,
Dr. Bleyer took many sciagraphs with the camera.
He calls it the photofluoroscope, which, however, will probably
not meet with favor for the name does not suggest the nature
of the instrument. When two radically different devices are
combined into one, it is difficult to formulate an acceptable
single word, and, therefore, the instrument will probably always
be called by some of the following terms: A camera with sciascopic
adjustment, or combined sciascope and camera, or corresponding
combinations with the word fluoroscope.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the time that Roentgen’s discovery was announced,
scientists throughout the world have made careful experiments,
up to date, in all possible directions, and the time has now come
when the number of experiments is rapidly decreasing, only one
or two being noted now and then in the scientific press, and
consisting mostly in repetition, with occasionally a slight departure,
involving a radically new subordinate discovery; but
in view of the great number of scientists, and of their high
standing as careful experimenters, and because also of their
desire to be correct in their inferences, there might seem to be
little else to be investigated. Time only will tell. Before passing

from those occurring in light rays, for the slits exhibited light
diffraction very well, but there was no evidence, by a widening
of the image on the plate, that X-rays had been diffracted in the

that they thought that a practical application could be made by
using selenium for detecting X-rays, both qualitatively and
quantitatively. In repeating the experiments, it must be borne
in mind that one half hour or so is required for selenium to return
to its former degree of ohmic resistance after being struck
by light or heat or X-rays.</p>

existed. Ten weeks before, a needle had entered the palm
while washing the floor. It had entered at the base of the
fifth metacarpal bone. Chloroform had been given and an incision
made, but no needle found and its presence doubted. A
sciagraph was taken and the needle was accurately located and
the next day removed.</p>

World</i>, Mar. 21, ’96.—Bullets were clearly located in the hands
of two different men by Prof. Dayton C. Miller, of the Case
School of Applied Science. In one, the bullet had been lodged
for 14 years and had always been thought to lie between the
bones of the forearm, but two sciagraphs from different directions
located the ball at the base of the little finger. By means
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>of five sciagraphs from different directions, the ball in the other
hand was located at the base of the thumb.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E204'></a>204. <span class='sc'>Injuries by Accident and Miscellaneous Cases.</span> <i>The
Integral</i>, Cleveland, Ohio, ’96.—Many fingers and hands were examined
by Prof. Miller that had been injured by planing machines,
cog-wheels, base balls, pistols, etc., and in each case the
nature of the injuries was determined. Several cases of fractured
arms were studied—some through splints and bandages.
Some sciagraphs indicated that the ends of the broken bones
had not been placed in apposition. Subsequently, an operation
was performed to remedy the setting. In one case, he sciagraphed
the arm from which a piece of the ulna had been
removed five years previously. The necrosis had increased.
Two sciagraphs at right angles to each other clearly exhibited
the nature of the disease. The permanent set of the toes by
wearing pointed shoes was clearly exhibited (p. <a href='#Page_30'>30</a>.) The figure
on page <a href='#Page_147'>147</a> is the side view of a foot in a laced shoe. The outlines
of the bones can be traced, also the eyelets and the pegs
in the heel, while the uppers scarcely appear. In Fig. <a href='#f020a'>1</a> (introduction)
is shown a head, only the skull being clearly reproduced.
In the negative, the teeth appear and places whence the teeth
have been extracted, also the jaw bones, nasal cavities and the
ragged junction of the bones and cartilage. The varying thickness
is represented in the cut, at the temples and ears. Fig. <a href='#f020b'>2</a>
(introduction) shows that a broken bone was badly set, the ends
overlapping each other instead of meeting end to end. A sciagraph
of an elbow is shown on p. <a href='#Page_161'>161</a>. The flesh is scarcely
visible. Fig. <a href='#f020c'>3</a> (introduction) is a picture which reproduced the
mere indication of the spine and ribs. In the original negative
the collar bones, pelvis, clavicles, buckle of clothing and location
of the heart and stomach were faintly outlined. Fig. <a href='#f020d'>4</a> (introduction)
is a representation of the knee of a boy 15 years old, in
knickerbockers, showing the buttons clearly, and dimly a 32

repeated in <i>Dental Cosmos</i>, June, ’96.—Dr. William J. Morton, of
New York, made several important examinations of the human
system by the use of X-rays.</p>

<p class='c008'>In regard to application in dentistry, he stated:—“Each
errant fang is distinctly placed, however deeply imbedded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>within its alveolar socket; teeth before their eruption stand
forth in plain view; an unsuspected exostosis is revealed; a
pocket of necrosis, of suppuration, or of tuberculosis is revealed
in its exact outlines; the extent and area and location of metallic
fillings are sharply delineated, whether above or below the
alveolar line. Most interesting is the fact that the pulp-chamber
is beautifully outlined, and that erosions and enlargements
may be readily detected.”</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E206'></a>206. The author saw one of Dr. Morton’s original photographed
sciagraphs of the thorax, 15 inches by 11 inches, not at
all creditably reproduced at page <a href='#Page_161'>161</a>. In the original, to the
surgeon’s eye: “The acromion and coracoid processes of the
shoulder blade are clearly shown in their relations to the head
of the humerus, or arm bone, and also the end of the clavicle,
or collar bone, is shown in its relations to the shoulder joint.
We have, in short, an inner inspection in a living person of this
rather complicated joint, the shoulder, and there can be no
doubt that in defined pictures of this nature even very slight
deformities and diseases would be detected. It is noticeable
that the front portions of the ribs are not shown, only the posterior
portions lying nearest to the sensitized plate appear; also
the breastbone was sufficiently dense to almost entirely obstruct
the X-rays. A collar button at the back of the neck is taken
through the backbone. In some of my negatives the dark outline
of the heart and liver is shown as well as the outlines of
tumors in the brain; but this is evidently for purposes of demonstrating
the location of organs, an over-exposure, and does
not, therefore, indicate the outlines of the heart.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The time of exposure was reduced by the use of a fluorescent
screen in conjunction with the photographic plate.</p>
<p class='c013'><a id='E207'></a>207. A woman was troubled with a stiffened wrist. Dr.
Morton took a single sciagraph of both wrists side by side as
shown at page <a href='#Page_174'>174</a>, (the photographic print being presented for
this book by E. B. Meyrowitz, 104 East 23d Street, N.Y.) The
injured wrist in the picture exhibited the Colles’ Fracture—the
ulna and radius bones being telescoped into their
fractured ends by a fall upon the sidewalk a year before. By
knowing the cause, the manner of cure became evident, and,
accordingly, the patient is expected to bend the wrist backward
and forward and laterally several times a day.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dr. Morton, in a lecture before the Medical Society of the
County of New York, to be printed in the <i>Medical Record</i>, related
that another promising field of research and application is
in the detection of calcareous infiltrations involving, for instance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>the arteries, or occurring in the lungs and other tissues. Calculi
in kidneys, in the bladder, in the salivary ducts have
already been successfully located. The stages of ossification,
and the epiphyseal relations of the osseous structure in children
may be pictured as is demonstrated in the picture of the entire
skeleton of an infant five months of age. The sciagraph shows
plainly that it will be possible to detect spinal diseases, either
in children or in adults. (<i>Not reproduced.</i>)</p>

how an X-ray diagnosis would agree with that previously
made by the hospital staff. (See also <a href='#E142'>§ 142</a>, at end.) The
outline of an enlarged liver, 7 inches in diameter, was easily
distinguished, the two outlines, one by percussion and one by
X-rays, agreeing better in favor of the latter by 1/2 inch. An
enlarged spleen was perfectly outlined. The tuberculosis of
one lung caused it to be more opaque than the sound lung. It
was found necessary to take into account the seams of clothing,
buttons, buckles, etc. A bullet was found exactly under the
spot which they marked as being over the bullet. A foreign
metallic body can be easily detected in the œsophagus, because
the latter is quite transparent. They could see the shadows of
the cartilaginous rings in the trachea, glottis, and epiglottis.
Younger persons, up to 10 years of age, are more transparent
than older.</p>

</div>
<hr class='c007' />
<p class='c008'>Before attempting to discuss the facts now known in regard
to the Roentgen phenomena, it is well to review briefly the
known ways in which radiant energy may be transmitted.</p>

<p class='c008'>By radiant energy is, of course, meant energy proceeding outward
from a source and producing effects at some distant point.
There are two well understood ways in which energy may be
transmitted,—first, by an actual transfer to the distant point of
matter to which the energy has been imparted from the source,
as in the flight of a common ball, a bullet, or a charge of shot.
In this mode of transmission, it is evident that the flying particles,
assuming that they are subject to no forces on the way,
will move in straight lines from the source to the distant point.
They constitute real rays, diverging from the source; an obstacle
in their path, would, if the radiations proceeded from a
point, cast a shadow with sharply defined edges.</p>

<p class='c008'>Second,—by a transfer of the energy from part to part of an
intervening medium, each part as it receives the energy, transmitting
it at once to the parts around it, no part undergoing
more than a slight displacement from its normal position. This
mode of transmission constitutes wave motion. The source imparts
its energy to the particles of the medium near it. Each
of those particles transfers its energy to the particles all around
it. Each of these particles in turn transfers its energy to the
particles around it, and so on through the medium. It is plain
that there are here no such things as genuine rays. As the
energy is transferred from particle to particle, each in turn becomes
a centre of disturbance transmitting its motion in all directions.
It is only because the movements transmitted from
different points annul one another except along certain lines,
that we have apparent straight lines of transmission, and, therefore,
fairly sharp shadows. But shadows produced by wave
transmissions are never absolutely sharp. The wave movement
is always propagated to some extent within the boundary of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>geometrical shadow, less as the wave lengths are shorter. With
sound waves whose lengths are measured in inches or feet, the
penetration into the shadow is considerable. With light waves
1/37000 to 1/70000 of an inch in length, the penetration into the
shadow is very small and requires specially arranged apparatus
to show that it exists.</p>

<p class='c008'>This penetration into the geometrical shadow is characteristic
of energy propagated by wave motion, and if the fact of such
penetration can be demonstrated, it is conclusive proof of propagation
by waves.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another characteristic of wave motion is found in the phenomena
of <i>interference</i>. This is the mutual effect of two
wave systems, which, when meeting at a given point, may
strengthen or annul each other according to the conditions under
which they meet. Either of those characteristics should enable
us to distinguish between propagation by wave motion and by
projected particles. But when wave lengths are very short and
radiations feeble, the tests are not easy to apply.</p>

<p class='c008'>Again, a wave is in general propagated with different velocities
in different media. This causes a deflection or deformation
of the wave as it passes from one medium into another, and results
in <i>refraction</i>, as in the cases of light and sound. Absence of
refraction would be strong though not conclusive evidence
against a wave theory of propagation.</p>

<p class='c008'>In wave propagation, each particle of the medium suffers a
small displacement from its equilibrium position and performs
a periodic motion about that position. This displacement may
be in the line of propagation—longitudinal vibration—or it may
be in a plane at right angles to that line—transverse vibration.
All the phenomena mentioned above, diffraction, interference,
refraction, and also reflection, belong equally to either mode of
wave propagation. Other phenomena must be made use of to
distinguish between these.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the vibrations are transverse they may all be brought
into one plane through the line of propagation. They may be
<i>polarized</i>, when the ray will present different phenomena upon
different sides. When the vibrations are longitudinal, no such
phenomena can be produced. Polarization, then, serves to distinguish
between longitudinal and transverse vibrations.</p>

<p class='c008'>Now let us consider briefly the Roentgen ray phenomena that
bear upon the question of the nature of the propagation.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c013'>It seems to be settled beyond question that the origin of the
Roentgen rays is the fluorescent spot in the discharge tube.
<a href='#E107'>§ § 107</a>, <a href='#E108'>108</a>, <a href='#E111'>111</a>. The evidence seems overwhelming that within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>the tube, the phenomena are the result of streams of electrified
particles of the residual matter, shot off from the cathode in
straight lines, perpendicular to its surface. <a href='#E57'>§ 57</a>. This was
Crookes’ original theory, <a href='#E53'>§ 53</a>, <i>near centre</i>, and it seems to have
stood well the test of scientific criticism. These flying particles
falling upon anything in their path, give rise to X-rays. It is
preferable, but not essential, that the bombarded surface should
be connected electrically with the anode. <a href='#E113'>§ § 113</a>, and <a href='#E116'>116</a>.
The best results are obtained by using a concave cathode, and
placing at its centre the surface which is to receive the bombardment,
thereby concentrating the effect upon a small area.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nearly all experimenters agree in locating the origin of the
X-rays at this bombarded spot. The energy here undergoes a
transformation, and the X-rays represent one of the forms of
energy developed.</p>

<p class='c008'>What are the characteristics of this particular form of radiant
energy?</p>

<p class='c008'>It causes certain salts to fluoresce, <a href='#E66'>§ § 66</a>, <a href='#E84'>84</a>, and <a href='#E132'>132</a>, and it
affects the photographic plate. <a href='#E70'>§ § 70</a> and <a href='#E84'>84</a>. In these respects,
it is like the short wave length radiations from a luminous source.
It is, however, totally unlike these in its power of penetrating
numerous substances entirely opaque to light, such as wood,
paper, hard rubber, flesh, etc. In passing through hard rubber
and some other opaque insulators, X-rays are like the long wave
length radiations from heated bodies, but X-rays penetrate many
substances that are opaque to these long wave length radiations,
and they are especially distinguished from all forms of radiant
energy previously recognized, in their relative penetrating
power for flesh and bones which makes it possible to obtain the
remarkable shadow pictures which have become within three or
four months, so familiar to all the world.</p>

<p class='c008'>But these phenomena, although they serve to distinguish the
X-rays from all other forms of radiant energy, do not furnish
any clew to the nature of the X-rays themselves.</p>

<p class='c008'>In attempting to formulate a theory of X-rays, the idea that
first naturally presents itself is that they are due to some form
of wave motion.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c013'>The characteristics of wave motion are diffraction and interference
phenomena. So far, no positive evidence of diffraction,
<a href='#E110'>§ 110</a>, nor interference, <a href='#E89'>§ 89</a>, have been recognized, although
experiments, have been tried that would have shown plainly,
diffraction phenomena, had light been used in place of the
Roentgen radiations. <a href='#E170'>§ 170</a>. We must, therefore, conclude,
either that the Roentgen radiations in the experiments were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>too feeble to produce a record of the diffraction effects, or, that
they are not due to wave motion at all, unless of a wave length
very small even when compared with waves of light. The
absence of refraction is also opposed to any wave theory of the
Roentgen radiations, for it is difficult to believe that waves of
any kind could travel with the same velocity through all media,
which they must do if they suffer no deviation. <a href='#E86'>§ 86</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next supposition naturally is, that the phenomena are due
to streams of particles. It has been suggested that the rays
may be streams of <i>material</i> particles, but this theory cannot be
maintained in view of the fact that the rays proceed, without
hindrance, through the highest vacuum. <a href='#E72b'>§ § 72<i>b</i></a> and <a href='#E133'>133</a>, <i>near
end</i>. Neither is it consistent with the high velocity of propagation.
Molecules of gas could not be propelled <i>through air</i> with
any such velocity or to any such distance as X-rays are propagated.
Tesla has claimed <a href='#E139'>§ 139</a>, that the residual gases are
driven out through the glass of the vacuum bulb by the high
potential that he employs. This has not been confirmed by
other experimenters. It has been observed that the vacuum
may be greatly improved by working the bulb, <a href='#E121'>§ 121</a>, that is,
sending the discharge through it, but experimenters generally
have found that heating the bulb impairs the vacuum and
restores the original condition. The gases, were, therefore,
occluded during the electrical discharge, to be again set free by
heating the bulb. <a href='#E139b'>§ 139<i>b</i></a>. The rays may be ether streams,
perhaps in the form of moving vortices, but of such streams we
have no independent knowledge, and can only determine by
mathematical analysis, what their characteristics should be.
They would not suffer refraction, and would not produce interference
nor diffraction phenomena. Whether they would <i>do</i>
what the X-rays do, go through the flesh and not through bone,
through wood and not through metal, excite fluorescence, or
affect the photographic plate, cannot be said. There is evidence
that there are at least two kinds of X-rays, <a href='#E152'>§ 152</a>, differing in
penetrating power, though perhaps not differing in other respects.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c013'>X-rays have their origin only in electrical discharges in high
vacua. They are absent from sun-light and from light of the
electric arc, and other sources of artificial illumination, <a href='#E136'>§ 136</a>.
Proceeding from the bombarded spot, they are not deflected by
a magnet, except in an evacuated observing tube, as proved by
Lenard, <a href='#E72a'>§ 72<i>a</i></a>, and show no evidence of carrying an electric
charge like cathode rays, <a href='#E61'>§ 61<i>b</i></a>, p. <a href='#Page_47'>47</a>. On the contrary, they
will discharge either a negatively or positively charged body in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>their path. The evidence seems conclusive (Chap. <a href='#ch08'>VIII</a>.) that
the ultra-violet rays from an illuminating source also discharge
charged conductors. In this respect, therefore, there is a similarity
between the X-rays and ultra-violet light.</p>

<p class='c008'>The action of the waves of light upon a cell formed of selenium
lowers the resistance of the latter and herein is circumstantial
evidence at least, concerning the similarity of the properties of
X-rays and light, because the former are also found to increase
the conducting power of selenium. <a href='#E171'>§ 171</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The experiments of Roentgen, <a href='#E90'>§ 90</a>, seem to show that the
discharging effect of X-rays is due to the air through which the
rays have passed.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is certain that the discharge of electrified bodies by light
occurs more generally for negatively than for positively charged
bodies, <a href='#E99B'>§ § 99<i>B</i></a>, <a href='#E99I'>99<i>I</i></a>, and <a href='#E99S'>99<i>S</i></a>,
that it depends upon the nature, <a href='#E97b'>§ 97<i>b</i></a>, and density,
<a href='#E97a'>§ 97<i>a</i></a>, of the gas surrounding the body, and
also upon the material of the charged body itself. <a href='#E98'>§ 98</a>. The
discharge would, therefore, seem to be connected with a chemical
action, <a href='#E153'>§ 153</a>, <i>near end</i>, which is promoted by the rays. This
seems all the more probable, since it was found, <a href='#E98'>§ 98</a>, that the
more electro-positive the metal, the longer the wave length that
would influence the discharge. In this connection, it is well to
note that Tesla found, <a href='#E146a'>§ 146<i>a</i></a>, that in their power of reflecting
(or diffusing X-rays), the different metals stand in the same order
as in the electric contact series in air, the most electro-positive
being the best reflectors. It would be interesting to
know whether connecting the reflecting plate to earth, would,
in any way, vary its reflecting power.</p>

<p class='c008'>The X-rays seem to discharge some bodies, when positively
charged, and other bodies when negatively charged. They will
also give to some bodies a positive, and to others a negative
charge (<a href='#E90c'>§ 90<i>c</i></a>). Is the order here also that of the electrical contact
series in air? Are not all the phenomena of electrical charge
and discharge, of reflection or diffusion, and of X-rays, connected
with chemical action, as the apparent difference of potential, due
to contact, undoubtedly is? <a href='#E153'>§ 153</a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>An experiment by La Fay (<a href='#E139a'>§ 139<i>a</i></a>) seems to show that X-rays,
in air, after passing through a charged silver leaf, acquire the
property of being deflected by a magnet, as are the cathode rays

this is confirmed, it would go far to support the theory that
these rays are streams of <i>something</i>.</p>

<p class='c013'>The burden of proof, up to the present, seems to be against
any wave theory of the X-rays, for, although they are like the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>ultra-violet rays in producing fluorescence and in affecting the
photographic plate, and have some points of similarity to these
rays in their effect upon charged bodies, the X-rays are totally
unlike the ultra-violet, in respect to diffraction and interference
phenomena. In fact, the absence of such phenomena, if they
are really absent, is conclusive proof that the X-rays cannot be
wave motions, unless of a wave length extremely short even as
compared to waves of light.</p>

<p class='c008'>Since writing the above, I have seen an account of experiments
in relation to diffraction of X-rays, presented to the
French Academy by MM. L. Calmette and G. T. Huillier, in
which the authors claim to have obtained evidence that diffraction
occurs. The following translation of MM. Calmette and
Huillier’s paper is taken from the <i>Electrical Engineer</i>, N.Y., for
July 22, 1896.</p>

<p class='c008'>“We have the honor of submitting to the Academy some photographic
proofs obtained with the Röntgen rays by means of
the following arrangement.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very near the Crookes tube there is a screen “<span class='fss'>E</span>” (<i>diagram
omitted</i>), of brass, perforated by a slit, the width of which has
rarely reached a half mm. A second metal screen, <span class='fss'>E´</span>, is formed
of a plate provided with two slits or pierced with a window in
which is fixed a metal rod of 1 mm. in diameter. This screen
is placed at the distance, <i>a</i>, behind the former. Lastly, a photographic
plate, enfolded in two leaves of black paper, is placed at
the distance, <i>b</i>, behind the second screen, <span class='fss'>E´</span>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The following table indicates, for each proof, what is the
screen <span class='fss'>E´</span> used, and the value of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> + <i>a</i>:</p>

<p class='c013'>“On the proofs 1, 3, 5 the shadow thrown by the metallic rod
is bordered on each side by a light band which shows a maximum
of intensity. Within this shade we observe a zone less
dark, which seems to indicate that the Röntgen rays penetrate
into the geometrical shadow. Lastly, in proofs 3 and 5 we see,
in like manner, a maximum of intensity along the margins of
the window in which the rod is placed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“In the proof No. 7 we perceive, in the middle of the two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>white bands, a fine dark ray, while in the shadow of the rod
which separates the two slits there is seen a light ray.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“If we compare these results with those obtained with light
in the same conditions, the slit being relatively wide and the
intensity weak, it seems difficult not to ascribe them to the
diffraction of the Röntgen rays.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The proofs obtained in these experiments—which we propose
to continue—are not yet so distinct that we can measure
the wave length with any precision. But we are still led to
believe that this wave length is greater than that of the luminous
rays.—<i>Comptes Rendus.</i>” Of course, if diffraction phenomena
can be demonstrated, the question as to the radiations
being wave propagations, is settled, though the question whether
the vibrations are longitudinal or transverse, is still open.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before accepting any stream or vortex motion theory, we need
to know more about the X-ray phenomena, and more about
stream and vortex motion.</p>
